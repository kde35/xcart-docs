Welcome to X-Cart 5 developer documentation.

General idea of X-Cart customization is that each change can be done as a separate module. Since module files are separate from the core, upgrade of X-Cart can be performed simply by replacing files. The same way, module can be upgarded just by replacing its own files.

To achieve such flexibility there are certain approaches to X-Cart customization and we are going to go through them in this section.

1. {% link "How to create simple module in X-Cart" ref_G2mlgckf %}
2. [Structure of the software](https://devs.x-cart.com/getting_started/x-cart-structure.html).
3. {% link "How to apply design changes" ref_E88KCMDD %}.
4. {% link "How to apply changes to X-Cart business logic" ref_AF6bmvL6 %}.
5. [Working with database](https://devs.x-cart.com/getting_started/working-with-database.html).

There is also [the exercise book](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0zb1w5ydqwchgna/en-developer-exercises-x-cart-5.pdf "Getting started") that gives you real-world tasks, so you could practice your X-Cart 5 programming skills.
