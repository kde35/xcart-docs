Security is the main concern when it comes to e-commerce. Since financial transactions are the backbone of e-commerce, if not the entire purpose of it, any hesitation on the part of the customer when it comes to making online payments could spoil the e-commerce party. Outside of financial consequences, data breaches damage a brandâ€™s reputation and can cause once loyal customers to avoid putting their information at risk again.
