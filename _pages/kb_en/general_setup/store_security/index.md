Security is the main concern when it comes to e-commerce. Since financial transactions are the backbone of e-commerce, if not the entire purpose of it, any hesitation on the part of the customer when it comes to making online payments could spoil the e-commerce party. Outside of financial consequences, data breaches damage a brandâ€™s reputation and can cause once loyal customers to avoid putting their information at risk again.

Overall online store security depends both on the software and it's configuration and on the server the store is installed at, as even a perfect e-commerce solution can be ruined by a poor and improper server environment. Hence a store owner should pay special attention to a secure server environment when choosing a hosting for the store.

This section will guide you through the necessary configuration steps to secure your store. Use the {% link "Security Guide" ref_1w4jshzv %} as a check list to start with.
