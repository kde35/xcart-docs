The X-Cart 5 package available for download from the [www.x-cart.com](http://www.x-cart.com/) website is a 30-day feature-complete trial of the X-Cart 5 Business edition. This trial package is licensed for evaluation purposes only. To use your X-Cart 5 installation for purposes other than evaluation, you need a Full X-Cart 5 license (like Free, Business, Multivendor or Ultimate) which must be activated for your store. The feature comparison guide for the different types of Full X-Cart license is [available on our website](https://www.x-cart.com/software-pricing.html).

A Free license can be obtained and activated by anyone through the use of the Activate free license feature of the X-Cart 5 trial. Premium license types (Business, Multivendor and Ultimate) are non-free and must be purchased; for each X-Cart 5 license you purchase you get a license activation key which you must use to activate your license. Paid (non-free) addons for X-Cart 5 are also provided with licenses that require activation.

## Activate a Free X-Cart 5 license

This section explains how to activate a Free X-Cart 5 license to turn your X-Cart trial installation into a real X-Cart 5 Free edition store.

A {% link "video instruction on X-Cart 5 Free license activation" ref_X5ZLmSJV %} is available.

To start the activation process for a Free X-Cart 5 license, choose to **Activate free license** in the Admin area of your X-Cart 5 trial installation. For your convenience, this activate license link can be accessed using any of the methods below:  

   *   _Method 1:_
       In the popup box with the X-Cart Business trial expiration notice (this box appears every time you sign in to the Admin area), click on the "I have a license key" link:
       ![activate_in_trial_warning.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/activate_in_trial_warning.png)

       This will expand the popup box further down, an a link to activate a free X-Cart license will be revealed:
       ![activate_in_trial_warning1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/activate_in_trial_warning1.png)
       
       Click on the link to activate a free license.
       
   *   _Method 2:_ In the Admin area site header, click **Activate license key**:
       ![activate_in_topmessage.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/activate_in_topmessage.png)

       A popup box titled **License key registration** will be displayed with a link to activate a free X-Cart license. 
       
       Click on the link to activate a free license.
       ![activate_in_topmessage1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/activate_in_topmessage1.png)

   *    _Method 3:_ In the Admin menu, select **My addons** to go to the My Addons section. In this section, click the **Activate license key** button:
        ![activate_in_myaddons.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/activate_in_myaddons.png)

        A popup box titled **Activate your X-Cart installation first** will be displayed with a link to activate a free X-Cart license. 

        Click on the link to activate a free license:
        ![activate_in_myaddons1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/activate_in_myaddons1.png)


Once you have selected to activate a free X-Cart license, the popup box will be closed, and you will see a page with a warning about the consequences of free license activation:
         ![free_license_activation_warning.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/free_license_activation_warning.png)

Since the X-Cart 5 Business package on which the trial version is based includes more addons than the X-Cart 5 Free edition, activation of the Free license will cause some of the addons on your X-Cart installation to be removed. So basically what you see on this page is a list of addons that will be removed from your X-Cart installation.

Review the "to be removed" list and confirm your intention to continue with the activation of the Free license. If at a later time you need any of the addons that were removed as a result of the activation of the Free license, you will be able to upgrade your license to Premium and install the addons from the Premium package.

Scroll down to the bottom of the page and enter the email address to which you want X-Cart to register your Free license. Then click **Activate**.
          ![free_license_activation.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/free_license_activation.png)

X-Cart will activate your license, and the store will be re-deployed. The process may take as long as a few minutes. Take care not to close the page before the process has been fully completed.

Once your store has been re-deployed, you should see a success message.
          ![all_done.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/all_done.png)

Now you should check that you can open your X-Cart store Admin area and storefront, and navigate a few pages to make sure everything looks good (no error messages or obvious page display problems). 

You will notice that the Admin area header now shows the license type you have activated:
          ![xc5_licenses_free.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/xc5_licenses_free.png)

## Activating a Premium X-Cart 5 license (Business / Multivendor / Ultimate)

This section explains how to activate the license for X-Cart 5 Business, Multivendor and Ultimate editions.

A {% link "video instruction on X-Cart 5 Business license activation" ref_UUrbypsh %}  is available in the Webinars and video tutorials section of the X-Cart 5 Knowledge Base.

If you do not yet have a premium license but want to purchase one, you can do so straight from the Admin area of an installed X-Cart trial. The most evident method is to choose the option to **Purchase a premium license key** in the popup box with the X-Cart trial expiration notice (appears every time you sign in to the Admin area):        
          ![xc5_licenses_purchase_premium.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/xc5_licenses_purchase_premium.png)

Other methods to access the **Purchase a premium license key** button are:

   *   _Method 1:_ Click the **Activate key** button in the Admin area site header:
       ![xc5_licenses_activate_button_inheader.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/xc5_licenses_activate_button_inheader.png)
    
   *   _Method 2:_ Click the **Activate license key** button in the My Addons section:
       ![xc5_licenses_activate_button_ininstalledaddons.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/xc5_licenses_activate_button_ininstalledaddons.png)
        and then to click the **activate your X-Cart license** link:
        ![xc5_licenses_activate_first.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/xc5_licenses_activate_first.png)
        
   *   _Method 3:_ Click the **Activate license key** button in the X-Cart App Store:
       ![xc5_licenses_activate_button_inmktplce.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/xc5_licenses_activate_button_inmktplce.png)
       and then to click the **activate your X-Cart license** link:
       ![xc5_licenses_activate_first.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/xc5_licenses_activate_first.png)
       
When you purchase X-Cart 5 Business, Multivendor or Ultimate, a message is sent to your license registration email address with the subject "**Your X-Cart 5 license key**". This message contains a 16-letter code that you must use to activate your license. 

The key is also stored in your personal HelpDesk account in the section **My Licenses**:
       ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/8225232/8356149.png)

Be sure to have this key at the ready when you are going to activate your license.

If you lost the email message with your license key and experience problems logging in to your HelpDesk account, please contact X-Cart's Customer Service at **[support@x-cart.com](mailto:support@x-cart.com)**.

To activate your license, log in to the Admin area of your X-Cart 5 installation and submit your license key via the form for license activation (In X-Cart trial version, the form is available via all the same methods used to access the **Purchase a premium license key** button described above. If you have activated an X-Cart license previously, the license activation form is available only via the **Activate license key** button in the Installed Addons section or the **Activate license key** button in the X-Cart App Store). 
      ![xc5_licenses_enter_premium.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/xc5_licenses_enter_premium.png)

The license activation process will begin. As soon as it completed, a success message will be displayed at the top of the screen.

That is all; your license has been activated. Now, if you look at your Admin area header, you should be able to see the license type you have activated:
      ![xc5_licenses_ultimate.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/xc5_licenses_ultimate.png)

(The screenshot above demonstrates the result of activating an Ultimate license; for Multivendor license this would be "Multivendor", and for Business license this would be "Business").

## Activating an X-Cart 5 addon license

This section covers the topic of license activation for commercial (paid, non-free) addons for X-Cart 5.

A {% link "video instruction on X-Cart 5 addon license activation" ref_hU6Rb4tw %} is available in the Webinars and video tutorials section of the X-Cart 5 Knowledge Base.

When you purchase an X-Cart 5 addon license, you need to activate it. Within minutes of the purchase you get an email message with the subject '**Your **"**Addon_name**"** addon key**', where Addon_name is the actual name of the addon. You should use this key to activate your addon license. As soon as the license has been activated, the addon will be automatically installed in your store.

To activate an addon license, do the following:

1.  Log in to the Admin area of your X-Cart 5 installation and go to the X-Cart App Store (via the ** My addons** item in the main menu).

2.  Access the license activation form by clicking either the **Activate license key** button above the addon list or the **Activate key **link next to the name of the addon for which you are activating a license:
    ![xc5_licenses_addon_activate_via_mktplce.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/xc5_licenses_addon_activate_via_mktplce.png)
    The form for license activation looks as follows:
    ![xc5_licenses_addon_enter_license_key.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/xc5_licenses_addon_enter_license_key.png)
    If you are using the trial version, you will be requested to activate your X-Cart 5 license before you can activate the addon license:
    ![xc5_licenses_activate_first.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/xc5_licenses_activate_first.png)

3.  Enter your license key into the appropriate field and click **Activate**:
    ![xc5_licenses_activate_addon_key.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_qwhmJtqW/xc5_licenses_activate_addon_key.png)

    Provided that the submitted license key is valid, X-Cart will start downloading and installing the addon:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/8225232/8356157.png)

The process is likely to take a few minutes. Take care not to close the page before the process has been fully completed.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/8225232/8356158.png)

Once the addon installation has been completed, a confirmation message will be displayed at the top of the screen.

That is all. Your addon license has been activated, and the addon has been installed.
