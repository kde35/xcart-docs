What an online store should begin with? Right you are, with the software installation. 

X-Cart installation is an easygoing and straightforward process that won’t take much time. Just follow the steps from the installation guide and you’ll get a store ready for set-up and launch in minutes.

Once X-Cart is installed you need to activate the software license to make your store active and eligible for modules installation.
