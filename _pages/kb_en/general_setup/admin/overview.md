When you log in to your X-Cart Admin area, the first thing that you see is the Admin area Home page:

X-Cart Admin Home page shows information about orders awaiting processing, bestseller products and products low in stock, as well as your storeâ€™s recent sales stats and X-Cart community news. Right after the software installation the Admin Home page also shows a special {% link "X-Cart Quickstart Onboarding Wizard" ref_5xTo5Gmg %} that is aimed to help a store admin with the initial store setup.

## Admin Area Header

The Admin Area Header shows the software version in use and includes tools for a quick navigation and search through the store as well as a tool to open or close the storefront for customers. It also shows the store low-stock and updates alerts, App Store notifications and gives access to the admin profile and X-Cart user docs that can be of a great help in the store setup and management.
