The migration of data from X-Cart 4 to X-Cart 5 is based on the model importing. The data is processed in chunks, and the process may take a while depending on the volume of data that needs to be transferred.

To finely tune the process, the following settings are available in the `<X-Cart>/etc/config.local.php` file in your X-Cart 5 installation:

- **migration_chunk_length** defines the number of records to be processed during one iteration. The greater the value the faster the process will go, but it will be more likely that the process will be timed out by the server;
- **disable_secret_check** disables secret key check while connecting to DB;
- **disable_ssl_check** disables SSL check for URL-related operations; 
- **disable_follow_redirects** disables following HTTP redirects when processing URLs;
- **disable_images_import** disables import of all images;
- **enable_copy_ext_images** enables copying of external images to XC5 location. In other words, if your X-Cart 5 is on one server and X-Cart 4 is on another, X-Cart 5 will copy images by downloading it.

{% note info %}
If the `<X-Cart>/etc/config.local.php` file does not exist in your X-Cart 5 store, you will need to create it in order to use above settings. Below is the example of such file. Uncomment the settings you want to use by removing the ';' symbol at the front.
```php
; <?php /*
; WARNING: Do not change the line above
;
;  --------------------------------- 
; |   X-Cart 5 configuration file   |
;  --------------------------------- 

[migration_wizard]
;migration_chunk_length = 20
;disable_secret_check = true
;disable_ssl_check = true
;disable_follow_redirects = true
;disable_images_import = true
;enable_copy_ext_images = true

; WARNING: Do not change the line below
; */ ?>
```
{% endnote %}

{% note info %}
Do not apply any customizations before running the migration task and also make sure to remove all demo data from the installation. You can remove existing data from X-Cart via 'System tools > Remove data' section in your admin area.
{% endnote %}
