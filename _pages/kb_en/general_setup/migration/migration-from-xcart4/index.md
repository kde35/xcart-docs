## Introduction

This article describes how you can upgrade your existing X-Cart 4 store to X-Cart 5.

[General overview of upgrade options on x-cart.com](https://www.x-cart.com/x-cart-migration.html).

Basically, you have three routes:
1. You can perform the upgrade yourself (DIY option);
2. You can hire X-Cart team to perform the upgrade for you (Professional and Custom options);
3. You can hire 3rd party to perform the upgrade for you (DIY option + whatever agreement you come up with 3rd party).

This article describes how one can perform the data migration process themselves using 'X-Cart v4 to v5 Data Migration Wizard' module.

If you also need to transfer custom data and custom functionality, there is no guide for that. 
Custom functionality has to be re-implemented to X-Cart 5 and you can either do that yourself, hire 3rd party or [hire our development team](https://www.x-cart.com/contact-us.html) for this task.

The same applies to the custom data.

## Step 1: Find the right environment for the migration

The first step is essentially a preparation.

You need to make sure if your current server is {% link "compatible with X-Cart 5" ref_19hsx4O9 %} and if not, set up a new server for it or perform the upgrade locally.

Besides, you may want to check what data is migrated by the 'X-Cart v4 to v5 Data Migration Wizard' module.

## Step 2: Perform the initial data migration
## Step 3: Check if data was migrated properly
## Step 4: Switch your production store with X-Cart 5
## Step 5: Monitor performance of your store after the migration
