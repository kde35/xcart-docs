## Introduction
This article describes how you can upgrade your existing X-Cart 4 store to X-Cart 5.

[General overview of upgrade options on x-cart.com](https://www.x-cart.com/x-cart-migration.html).

Basically, you have three routes:
1. You can perform the upgrade yourself (DIY option);
2. You can hire X-Cart team to perform the upgrade for you (Professional and Custom options);
3. You can hire 3rd party to perform the upgrade for you.

This article assumes you are going for the first option and guides you through the whole process.

## What data will be migrated via module

The migration of data is done via our [Data Migration Wizard module](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/migration-wizard.html). Here is what data will be transferred by this module:

<table class="ui compact padded celled small table">
  <tbody>
    <tr class="top aligned">
      <td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"><span>Сonfiguration settings</span>
      </td>
      <td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd">
- General settings;
<br />- Default customer address; 
<br />- Weight and Length symbols; 
<br />- Purchase limits; 
<br />- Defaut admin/customer language; 
<br />- Ship-from address;          
<br />- Contact Us information. Contact Us form settings are not migrated to X-Cart 5;
<br />- SEO-friendly URLs. Clean URLs are enabled in X-Cart 5 automatically;
<br />
<br />- The currency is not transferred and you need to define the currency in X-Cart 5 before the migration;

        <p>In X-Cart Classic 4.0.x-4.4.x user passwords are stored in the database in encrypted form. Hence all user passwords are migrated safely providing that a valid Blowfish key is specified at the <a href="https://kb.x-cart.com/modules/xc4_to_xc5_migration_wizard/using_the_xc4_to_xc5_migration_wizard.html#step-2---connect" target="_blank">"Step 2 - Connect"</a> of the migration wizard.</p>
        <p> Starting from X-Cart Classic 4.5.x password hashing is used. Since hashed passwords cannot be decrypted, there is no way for passwords to be migrated from an X-Cart 4.5.x+ store to X-Cart 5. After the migration, the users will have to use the "Forgot password?" feature in the X-Cart 5 store to regain access to their accounts.</p>
