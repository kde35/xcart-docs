## Introduction
This article describes how you can upgrade your existing X-Cart 4 store to X-Cart 5.

[General overview of upgrade options on x-cart.com](https://www.x-cart.com/x-cart-migration.html).

Basically, you have three routes:
1. You can perform the upgrade yourself (DIY option);
2. You can hire X-Cart team to perform the upgrade for you (Professional and Custom options);
3. You can hire 3rd party to perform the upgrade for you.

This article assumes you are going for the first option and guides you through the whole process.

## What data will be migrated via module

The migration of data is done via our [Data Migration Wizard module](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/migration-wizard.html). Here is what data will be transferred by this module:

<table class="ui compact padded celled small table">
  <tbody>
    <tr class="top aligned">
      <td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"><span>Сonfiguration settings</span>
      </td>
      <td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd">
        <p>* Company information;
          <br><span>&nbsp;</span>
          <br>* General settings (
          <br>Default customer address; 
          Weight and Length symbols; 
          Purchase limits; 
          Defaut admin/customer language; 
          Ship-from address. 
          The currency is not copied from X-Cart 4 automatically in the process of migration but needs to be specified manually before the migration start. Before the migration of orders, an alert will be provided showing the currency selected in the store and warning the user that the orders will be migrated using that currrency.);
          <br><span>&nbsp;</span>
          <br>*   Contact Us (If your X-Cart 4 database contains an entry for contact_us, the Migration wizard requests that the addon "Contact Us" should be enabled in X-Cart 5; your X-Cart 4 store's Contact Us form settings are not checked and not migrated to X-Cart 5);
          <br><span>&nbsp;</span>
          <br>*   SEO-friendly URLs (If your X-Cart 4 store has the Clean URLs feature enabled, the Migration wizard automatically enables SEO-friendly URLs in X-Cart 5.)&nbsp;</p>

        <p>In X-Cart Classic 4.0.x-4.4.x user passwords are stored in the database in encrypted form. Hence all user passwords are migrated safely providing that a valid Blowfish key is specified at the <a href="https://kb.x-cart.com/modules/xc4_to_xc5_migration_wizard/using_the_xc4_to_xc5_migration_wizard.html#step-2---connect" target="_blank">"Step 2 - Connect"</a> of the migration wizard.</p>
        <p> Starting from X-Cart Classic 4.5.x password hashing is used. Since hashed passwords cannot be decrypted, there is no way for passwords to be migrated from an X-Cart 4.5.x+ store to X-Cart 5. After the migration, the users will have to use the "Forgot password?" feature in the X-Cart 5 store to regain access to their accounts.</p>
