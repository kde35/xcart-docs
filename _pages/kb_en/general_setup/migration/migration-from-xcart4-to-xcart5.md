## Introduction
This article describes how you can upgrade your existing X-Cart 4 store to X-Cart 5.

[General overview of upgrade options on x-cart.com](https://www.x-cart.com/x-cart-migration.html).

Basically, you have three routes:
1. You can perform the upgrade yourself (DIY option);
2. You can hire X-Cart team to perform the upgrade for you (Professional and Custom options);
3. You can hire 3rd party to perform the upgrade for you (DIY option + whatever conditions you settle with 3rd party).

This article describes how to perform the data migration process yourself.

If you also need to transfer custom data and custom functionality, there is no guide for that.
Custom functionality has to be re-implemented to X-Cart 5 and you can either do that yourself, hire 3rd party for that or [contact our development team](https://www.x-cart.com/contact-us.html).
The same applies to the custom data.

## What data will be migrated

The migration of data is done via our [Data Migration Wizard module](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/migration-wizard.html). Here is what data will be transferred by this module:

<br />- Contact Us information. Contact Us form settings are not migrated to X-Cart 5;
<br />- SEO-friendly URLs. Clean URLs are enabled in X-Cart 5 automatically;
<br />
<br />- The currency is NOT transferred and you need to define the currency in X-Cart 5 before the migration.

<br />How to transfer user passwords:
<br />- If you are migrating from X-Cart 4.1.x-4.4.x, you need to specify blowfish key on Hence all user passwords are migrated safely providing that a valid Blowfish key is specified at the <a href="https://kb.x-cart.com/modules/xc4_to_xc5_migration_wizard/using_the_xc4_to_xc5_migration_wizard.html#step-2---connect" target="_blank">Step 2 - Connect</a> of the migration wizard and passwords will be transferred properly;
<br />- If you are migrating from X-Cart 4.5.x and later, passwords will not work after the migration. In order to allow customers log in using old passwords, you need to install [Migration: Restore logins of X-Cart 4 users module](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/xcart-4-login.html) from the marketplace and specify X-Cart 4 blowfish key inside its settings.

## Technical side of how the module transfers the data

The migration of data from X-Cart 4 to X-Cart 5 is based on the model importing. The data is processed in chunks, and the process may take a while depending on the volume of data that needs to be transitioned.

The following settings are available via the `<X-Cart>/etc/config.local.php` file in your X-Cart 5 installation:

- **migration_chunk_length** defines the number of records to be processed during one iteration. The greater the value the faster the process will go, but it will be more likely that the process will be timed out by the server;
- **disable_secret_check** disables secret key check while connecting to DB;
- **disable_ssl_check** disables SSL check for URL-related operations; 
- **disable_follow_redirects** disables following HTTP redirects when processing URLs;
- **disable_images_import** disables import of all images;
- **enable_copy_ext_images** enables copying of external images to XC5 location. In other words, if your X-Cart 5 is on one server and X-Cart 4 is on another, X-Cart 5 will copy images by downloading it.

{% note info %}
If the `<X-Cart>/etc/config.local.php` file does not exist in your X-Cart 5 store, to use any of the above-named settings, you will need to create the file following the example below. Uncomment the settings that you want to set by removing the ';' symbol at the front.
```php
; <?php /*
; WARNING: Do not change the line above
;
;  --------------------------------- 
; |   X-Cart 5 configuration file   |
;  --------------------------------- 

[migration_wizard]
;migration_chunk_length = 20
;disable_secret_check = true
;disable_ssl_check = true
;disable_follow_redirects = true
;disable_images_import = true
;enable_copy_ext_images = true

; WARNING: Do not change the line below
; */ ?>
```
{% endnote %}

## Demo migration 
You may choose to run a migration in the Demo mode. Only a limited range of data is transferred during the demo migration. If you have really big store (say, 100 000 products), you can quickly see how your products, categories, orders, etc will look like on X-Cart 5 and after that make a decision about whether to proceed with the complete transfer of your store or not.

To run demo migration, select the 'Demo migration' option at the 'Select' step of the migration wizard, and only the following data will be migrated:

- 10 latest orders;
- Products from those orders; 
- Users for those orders;
- All the categories; 
- 10 products from one of the categories.

After demo migration is been completed, a link to the category with the migrated products will be provided, so the user can review these products. The rest of the X-Cart 4 store data (settings, destination zones, static pages, etc) will be migrated in full.

## Syncing the data

If you performed the data migration and want to transfer only new entities or those that were changed since the initial migration, you can use the 'Skip previously migrated data' option at the 'Transfer' step of the migration wizard.

This option is particularly handy if you ran the initial data migration, then spent some time tweaking X-Cart 5 store and now decide to go live. In this case, the majority of data is already on X-Cart 5 and you only need to sync the latest one.

{% note info %}
If you migrated some entity and then changed it on X-Cart 5 side, while X-Cart 4's version is still the same, this entity will still be skipped with the 'Skip previously migrated data' option enabled.
