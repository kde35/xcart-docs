X-Cart allows to set either VAT-inclusive or VAT-exclusive price representation if you use the {% link "VAT/GST addon" ref_0GjdgNJx %}.

Setting up VAT-inclusive prices has some peculiarities that a store admin should keep in mind when configuring taxes and prices.

{% note info %}
The guides below presumes that the {% link "VAT/GST addon" ref_0GjdgNJx %} is installed and enabled.
{% endnote %}

VAT inclusive prices representation can be enabled by the "Display prices in catalog including VAT/GST" option in the VAT/GST section of the admin area (**Store setup** -> **Taxes**). See more info on the VAT/GST addon set-up in {% link "Setting up VAT/GST " ref_0GjdgNJx %}.

Enabling this option automatically decreases all product prices defined earlier and displayed in the storefront by the % of VAT rate defined in the tax settings. The prices on the product details page in the admin area stay as they were previously defined. 

Moreover, whether a customer sees prices including or excluding VAT will also depend on the location defined for the "The VAT/GST inclusive prices as defined in the product details are intended for" setting.

Let's say that a product has a price set to £100. 
  ![product-100-admin.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4tqYojGn/product-100-admin.png)

A store admin proceeds to taxes configuration and enables the "Display prices in catalog including VAT/GST" option, and sets the "The VAT/GST inclusive prices as defined in the product details are intended for" to UK. Also the store admin sets several tax rates and defines VAT for UK as 20% and VAT for Hungary as 27%. 
  ![sample-UK.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4tqYojGn/sample-UK.png)

In this case the product price displayed in the storefront for a UK-based customer will be "£100 inc. VAT" (just the same as defined on the product details page in the admin area), for a customer from Hungary - "£105,83 inc. VAT" and for a customer from a location without a VAT rate defined - "£83.33".

  <div class="column" markdown="span">![vat-uk.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4tqYojGn/vat-uk.png)</div>
  <div class="column" markdown="span">![vat-hungary.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4tqYojGn/vat-hungary.png)</div>
</div>

This happens because X-Cart decreases the original product price by the percent of VAT defined for the location specified in the "The VAT/GST inclusive prices as defined in the product details are intended for" setting.

To avoid the mess as described above and set all prices predefined in the admin area as VAT-exclusive, a store admin should set the “The VAT/GST inclusive prices as defined in the product details are intended for” option value to “All addresses (default zone)” or any tax zone with a 0% tax rate. Then set the VAT tax rates for the locations it's applied for.

If configured the abovementioned way the product price defined in the store admin area as £100 will be displayed in the storefront for a UK-based customer as "£120 inc. VAT" (£100 + VAT 20%), for a customer from Hungary - "£127 inc. VAT" (£100 + VAT %27) and for a customer from a location without a VAT rate defined - "£100".
