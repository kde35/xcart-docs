Both the UK and the EU use value-added tax system (VAT). Each EU country and the UK has a different VAT rate that can be charged by a merchant only if the business is registered for VAT. A registered business must provide a VAT invoice in case there is no VAT exemption for the goods.

VAT rates and VAT exemptions in X-Cart can be set-up manually using the {% link "VAT/GST addon" ref_0GjdgNJx %}.
