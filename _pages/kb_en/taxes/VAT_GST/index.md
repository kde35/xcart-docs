If you are required to charge buyers a value added tax (VAT) or a goods and services tax (GST), we recommend using the addon [**Value Added Tax / Goods and Services Tax**](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/uk-vat.html) for tax setup.

This addon is designed specially for businesses in the UK, EU, Australia and other countries where an ability to charge VAT / GST is a must. The addon allows you to use different tax rates based on the membership level and address of the customer. It also supports tax exemption based on customer's VAT ID.

{% note info %}
Note that we have a special addon for {% link "Canadian taxes" ref_hxmof6xX %}.

To start using the addon "Value Added Tax / Goods and Services Tax", ensure that it is {% link "installed and enabled" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %} in your store.

Please find below some guidance on how to set up and enable VAT / GST calculation using the addon "Value Added Tax / Goods and Services Tax" for X-Cart 5.
