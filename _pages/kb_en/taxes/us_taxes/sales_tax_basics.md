Currently 45 states plus the District of Columbia impose a general sales tax, 5 states (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hamphire, Oregon) has no general sales tax though some local areas within these states may be able to charge a sales tax. Sales tax rates vary by state, and by locality within a state. 

There are different types of sales taxes imposed by the states. Some states are Seller Privilege Tax states (may also be callded origin-based sales tax states) while others are Consumer Tax states (may also be called destination-based sales tax states).  This determines who is primarily liable for the payment of the tax.

Origin-based sales tax states are fairly simple. If you are based in an origin-based state, you charge the amount of state and local sales tax effective at your business’ location to everyone who you ship taxable items to in that state. So your location would be your office, warehouse, place where your inventory is stored, etc.

Destination-based sales tax states are trickier. If you have sales tax nexus in a destination-based state, you must calculate the sales tax rate effective where your buyer is located. This means you would charge multiple sales tax rates within a state.

Not to mention, some states are different based on whether you live there (home state nexus) or you are considered a “remote seller.”

For either basis, the location is determined by the 5-digit zip code of either your store’s address or the shipping address of your customer. The rates in effect for that zip code are then used in the tax calculations.


The state(s) where your client collects sales tax also determines whether they should charge sales tax on shipping charges. Some states consider shipping charges to be a necessary part of a taxable eCommerce transaction, and require online sellers to charge sales tax on any delivery charges. Other states don’t require online sellers to charge sales tax on shipping charges if the charge is clearly separated from the price of the taxable products.
