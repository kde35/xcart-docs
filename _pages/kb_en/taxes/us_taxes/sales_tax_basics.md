There is no national general sales tax in the US, each state governes sales tax at the state level and collects it from the merchants who have nexus (phisical or economical presence) there. As of Janyary 2019, 45 states plus the District of Columbia impose a general sales tax, 5 states (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hamphire, Oregon) has no general sales tax though some local areas within these states may be able to charge a sales tax. Sales tax rates vary by state, and by locality within a state (a county, city, or any special taxing district). 

There are different types of sales taxes imposed by the states. Some states collect taxes on an origin basis while the others on a destination basis.

If a merchant is based in an origin-based state, he charges sales tax at the rate in the state where the merchant is located. A merchant's location would be an office, warehouse, place where the inventory is stored, etc. 

If a merchant has sales tax nexus in a destination-based state, he charges sales tax at the rate in the state where the product is delivered. 

California is more complicated: the state, county, and city taxes are origin-based, but any district taxes are destination-based.

For either basis, the location is determined by the 5-digit zip code of either a store’s business address or the shipping address of a customer. The rates in effect for that zip code are then used in the tax calculations.

A state where a merchant collects sales tax also determines whether they should charge sales tax on shipping charges. Some states consider shipping charges to be a necessary part of a taxable eCommerce transaction, and require online sellers to charge sales tax on any delivery charges. Other states don’t require online sellers to charge sales tax on shipping charges if the charge is clearly separated from the price of the taxable products.
