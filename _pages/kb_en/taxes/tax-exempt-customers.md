In some situations, you may need to offer a tax exemption to a portion of customers, such as government agencies or nonprofit organizations. To prevent your store from charging taxes on these customers, you will need to mark the customer as tax-exempt.

The process for making specific customers tax-exempt will differ depending on whether you have set taxes up manually or automatically (with Avalara AvaTax).
