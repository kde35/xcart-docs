In some situations, you may need to offer tax exemption to a portion of customers (government agencies, resalers, b2b sales, etc). To prevent your store from charging taxes on these customers, you will need to mark the customer as tax-exempt.

The process for making specific customers tax-exempt will differ depending on whether you have set taxes up manually or automatically.

Automatical tax-exempt feature is supported in {% link "Avalara AvaTax " ref_27HUrpf1 %} and can be added by a special Tax Exempt module that also makes possible to add a tax-free option to some products or groups of products (nessecity goods, digital goods, services, etc.).

To set up a tax-exempt option manually you'll need to:

1. Create a special tax-exempt membership and assign it the customers that can order goods tax free - See more info on memberships creation in {% link "Managing User Membership Levels" ref_RXsgxNSm %}
  
  {% note info %}
  You'll need to devide all your customers into groups and assign a special membership level to each of the groups depending on whether the customer is tax-exempt or not.
  {% endnote %}
  
2. Create the store tax system based on the memberships - See more info on taxes set-up in {% link "Setting up sales tax" ref_aJPK4DHN %}
  
  {% note info %}
  When setting up taxes disable the **Use the same tax rates for all user membership levels** option and create tax rates based on the memberships used in the store. The tax-exempt membership should have a 0% tax rate applied.
