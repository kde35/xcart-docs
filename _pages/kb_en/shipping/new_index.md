Once an order has been paid for, the merchant needs to deliver it to the buyer, which includes packaging and the rest of the order fulfillment. Choose whether to ship goods on your own or to rely on a shipping company that will deliver goods to the buyers on your behalf. Remember that logistics are a vital part of any ecommerce businessâ€™s operations. 

There are some basics that set a foundation for the rest of your shipping. While you can come back and change each of these later on, as you learn more, these are the key decisions and steps that make up your high-level shipping strategy.

* _Your shipping rates and methods_

  Will you offer free or flat-rate shipping to absorb some or all of the cost or will you pass the full cost of shipping on to your customers? If the later, will you use real-time shipping carriers like UPS, CanadaPost, DHL or whatever or will you use custom shiping rates, that you can control yourself?
  
  {% note info %}
  For unregistered customers, shipping rates are displayed at checkout in the very same order they are set in the admin area (first comes the first active shipping method from the shipping settings page (**Store setup** -> **Shiping**)). 
  
  For registered customers, the first shipping method displayed at checkout will be the one they used for the previous order. The rest of the shipping methods will come in the order of active shipping methods defined in the admin area.
  {% endnote %}

* _Product weights_

  To streamline the process, measure and update the weight of each product you sell. Having that information set up will help you get a good sense of your total costs, and pass along accurate prices to your customers.


* _Effective ecommerce shipping strategy_

  Before you can ship products you will need to decide on your shipping strategy. 

  X-Cart can be configured to get shipping rates in real time from popular carrier companies or to use custom shipping rates that you can set and control yourself. It is even possible to combine the two approaches. In this section you will find a guide on the basic shipping configuration and setup as well as some use cases that may be helpful to understand the overall shipping opportunities.
