Once an order has been paid for, you will need to deliver the ordered goods to the buyer. Unless those are products that do not require shipping (like {% link "digital goods" ref_lxNH6TFr %}, {% link "bookable products" ref_4IYL2Shf %} or {% link "PIN codes" ref_4JeE99n8 %}), you will have to arrange the packaging, pickup and delivery.

If you sell products that do not require shipping, see the section {% link "Shipping Setup for Products That Do Not Require Shipping" ref_z5KmbFAu %}.

Depending on your business scope and the distance between your warehouse and the buyer's location, you will either have to deliver the goods to the buyer on your own or will have to use the services of a shipping company that will deliver the goods on your behalf. Considering all the costs associated with getting an order to the buyer - including the cost of packaging, shipping, tracking, insurance and customs/duties (if you cover them) - you may find shipping to be a major expense in your business. To keep things profitable, you will need to come up with an effective shipping strategy for your business. 

Some key decisions will have to be made regarding your pricing strategy for shipping. Some popular options here are as follows:

## Offer Free Shipping
*   {% link "Free Shipping" ref_BCq5l4MP %}
## Charge Real-Time Carrier Rates
*   {% link "Carrier-calculated Shipping Rates" ref_ybdiN8r0 %}
*   {% link "Custom Table Rates" ref_3TG6AuN0 %}
## Charge a Flat Rate

X-Cart is integrated with the real-time shipping carriers and supports custom shipping rates as well that you can set up and control yourself. Moreover you can combine both ways for more profit if necessary. Below you will find a guide on the basic shipping configuration and setup as well as some use cases that may be helpful to understand the overall shipping opportunities.

Note that your strategy might change as your business grows. It is never a bad idea to reevaluate your original decisions to ensure that you are delivering the absolute best possible service and experience for the best possible price to your customers. X-Cart offers flexible shipping settings, so should you decide to change your shipping strategy, you will be able to adjust your store's shipping configuration at any time to meet your business needs.
