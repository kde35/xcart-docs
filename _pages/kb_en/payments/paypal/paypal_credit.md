Support for PayPal Credit can be enabled in an X-Cart based store via the addon **[PayPal](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/paypal.html "PayPal addon")** by X-Cart team. It is not an independent method of payment, but rather a payment source that your customers can employ to pay you via PayPal.  

PayPal Credit allows your customers to pay for their purchases without entering their debit or credit card information on your store website, or sharing their personal data with you. You still get paid right away. 
More information on PayPal Credit is available on [PayPal's website](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-credit).
