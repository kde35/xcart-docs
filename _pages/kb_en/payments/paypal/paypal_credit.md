Support for PayPal Credit can be enabled in an X-Cart based store via the addon **[PayPal](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/paypal.html "PayPal addon")** by X-Cart team. It is not an independent method of payment, but rather a payment source that your customers can employ to pay you via PayPal.  

PayPal Credit allows your customers to pay for their purchases without entering their debit or credit card information on your store website, or sharing their personal data with you. You still get paid right away. 
More information on PayPal Credit is available on [PayPal's website](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-credit).

To get the ability to enable the PayPal Credit payment option for your customers, you need to configure one of PayPal payment methods for your store.

For example, we chose to enable PayPal Express Checkout. After submitting the required credentials for access to the API and saving the settings on the PayPal Express Checkout settings page, we get a new tab on the page - the one for PayPal Credit:

(This will be the same for all PayPal methods: as soon as you configure a PayPal method, you will get this PayPal Credit tab on the method configuration page.)

To enable PayPal Credit, we will need to go to this new tab and adjust a few settings.
