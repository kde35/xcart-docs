PayPal is one of the largest payment processors in the world and offers many different payment solutions. In case a merchant considers accepting payments on site via PayPal it's vitally important to choose a proper PayPal solution that will meet the business needs best of all, as offering PayPal can make a store accessible to different types of shoppers which is critical to the store's conversion rate. In X-Cart, a merchant has quite a big list of integrated PayPal solutions to choose from. 

Customers don’t even need a PayPal account to pay via PayPal – they can use their bank account or credit card to complete checkout, but can use their PayPal balance with an account.

## PayPal Standard

PayPal Standard is one of the most popular gateways for merchants, as there are no setup fees, termination fees, or merchant accounts needed to get set up – all you need is a [PayPal Business account](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant "PayPal Solutions Overview"). PayPal Standard is available in [200+ countries](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide "PayPal Solutions Overview"), so almost any merchant can use it.

Transactions via PayPal Standard are processed on PayPal’s site (not your own), and will allow customers to pay with a PayPal balance or credit card. Your customers will be sent to PayPal from your store checkout, and you will be charged the standard PayPal transaction fee for these payments. Customers are then directed back to your site after completing the PayPal checkout. PayPal also offers volume discounts if you process over $3000 in transactions with PayPal monthly.

Since checkout is completed on PayPal’s site, you have to rely on PayPal send payment success and failure notifications back to your store for completed orders using Instant Payment Notifications (IPN). Using the PayPal IPN can occasionally be unreliable, which can sometimes result in the orders not being completed correctly on your store, which is one of the downsides to PayPal Standard.

## PayPal Express Checkout

PayPal Express Checkout is available in the same countries as PayPal Standard, and you will be charged the same PayPal transaction fees with no setup or termination fees. PayPal Express Checkout is very similar to PayPal Standard with one major difference: the checkout flow.

PayPal Express Checkout avoids the IPN issues that arise with PayPal Standard. Customers will be directed to PayPal from your site, but they don’t complete checkout at PayPal. Instead, customers approve a purchase at PayPal, then they are directed back to your site with a token (this token is passed to your site behind-the-scenes).

The token can be used by your site to submit a final payment to PayPal. When a customer clicks to finish placing the order on your site after being directed back, this finalizes the order and sends that token back to PayPal with the final order details.

This is a more reliable payment method than PayPal Standard, as the checkout is completed on your site, but the payment is done on PayPal’s servers once your token is returned to PayPal.

## PayPal Advanced

PayPal Advanced is available for merchants in the US and Canada only by far and includes online payments and invoicing for merchants along with a checkout directly on your site like PayPal Pro.

There are no setup or termination fees, but PayPal Advanced requires a $5 monthly fee along with PayPal transaction fees. The difference between PayPal Advanced and PayPal Pro is that the checkout form is on your site and embedded in your checkout process, but is not something that you can customize entirely.

The PayPal Advanced checkout form is an iframed form, which means that the form is actually hosted on PayPal’s servers and embedded on your checkout page. From the customers point of view, they remain on your site and in your checkout flow for purchasing, but the payment form is actually hosted by PayPal and payment information is sent directly to their servers.

## PayPal Payments Pro

There are no startup or termination fees with PayPal Payments Pro, but there is a $30 monthly fee along with a per-transaction fee (volume discounts are still available). PayPal Payments Pro also includes the PayPal Virtual Terminal to allow you to accept payments over the phone, the ability to accept bank transfers and in-person payment, as well as online invoicing.

The biggest difference to using PayPal Payments Pro is that you can customize the entire checkout experience, as customers remain on your site during the checkout process rather than being directed to PayPal to complete checkout or approve payments.

PayPal Pro is available to merchants in the UK, US, and Canada. 

## PayPal Payflow Link

There are no startup or termination fees with PayPal Payflow Link, only the regular PayPal transaction fees. This integration combines credit card processing with PayPal Express Checkout functionality. Do not turn PayPal Express Checkout on, or the two versions will conflict with one another.

With Payflow Link, your customers are linked to _Order_ forms on PayPal’s secure Web server where
transactions are processed in real time.

Customizable to your Web site. You can customize the look and feel of the PayPalhosted Order forms to reflect your Web site design.
 Responsive and reliable. Payflow Link immediately advises customers whether their
transaction was successful.
 Email receipt notification. With approved transactions, Payflow Link can send an email
confirmation receipt to you and to your customers.
 High security. All transactions processed on PayPal-hosted forms occur over secure SSL
connections. All certificates required to ensure both authentication and security are hosted
by PayPal. You can specify that only certain Web pages (for example, your e-commerce
site) are valid entry points for the transaction processing pages.
 Fraud protection. Payflow Link supports a large set of automated fraud protection tools,
including Card Security Code (CSC).

{% note info %}
If your Web site processes more than 500 transactions per month, you should consider using Payflow Pro, PayPal’s high performance Internet payment solution.

## PayPal powered by Braintree

This integration combines credit card processing with PayPal Express Checkout functionality in an interface that lets your customers pay with their PayPal account without ever leaving your storefront. Do not turn PayPal Express Checkout on, or the two versions will conflict with one another.

In addition to processing credit cards on your checkout page, PayPal powered by Braintree offers more advanced functionality than other PayPal integrations, including support for 3D Secure and PayPal One Touch.
