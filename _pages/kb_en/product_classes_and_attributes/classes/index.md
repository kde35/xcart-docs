Product classes is an extention to the {% link "Product Attributes" ref_4Bx31Gpv %} feature that gives a . store admin the tools to join products in groups other than product categories and subcategories and use these groups for {% link "filtering products" ref_6e82A7rL %} in the storefront.

When some products in your catalog have certain characteristics in common and need to be handled together as a group, it may be a good idea to configure a product class for them. 

Product classes are listed and managed in the **Classes & attributes** section (**Catalog** > **Classes & attributes**) of your store’s Admin area:

This page allows a store admin to check the number of products with a certain product class assigned as well as to check the list of attributes for each specific product class by clicking the _Edit attributes (N) link opposite_the product class name.

{% note warning %}
Product classes must have {% link "product class attributes" ref_kEKoAxJB %} configured for them.
{% endnote %}
