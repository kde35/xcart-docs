When some products in your catalog have certain characteristics in common and need to be handled together as a group, it may be a good idea to configure a product class for them. 

Product classes are listed and managed in the **Classes & attributes** section (**Catalog** > **Classes & attributes**) of your storeâ€™s Admin area:
