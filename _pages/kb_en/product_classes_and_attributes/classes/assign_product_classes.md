To show that a certain product belongs to a certain product class, you need to go to the product's details and assign the product class to it. 

To assign a product class to a product:

1.  In your store's Admin area, find the product to which you want to assign a product class, open its details and click on the** Attributes** tab. We will do this to a product named "Critter Print Melamine Plate 10 inch Set of 4, Orange Cat" (In this example we will assign the product class "Plates" to it):

2.  On the page that opens, click the Global link to access the subsection where you can manage the product's global and product class attributes:

3.  On the page that opens, you will see whether the product already has a product class assigned. In our case, no product class is assigned. To assign a new class, click the **Change** button:
    ![assign-class-3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4PN1b5la/assign-class-3.png)
    This will expand a section with a drop-down box titled **Product class**:

4.  From the list in the **Product class** drop-down box, select the name of the product class you would like to assign (If an appropriate product class has not yet been created, select the _New product class_ item to add it):
    ![assign-class-5.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4PN1b5la/assign-class-5.png)
5.  Click the **Save changes** button to apply the selected product class name:
    ![assign-class-6.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4PN1b5la/assign-class-6.png)
    The product class will be assigned to the product:
    ![assign-class-7.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4PN1b5la/assign-class-7.png)
