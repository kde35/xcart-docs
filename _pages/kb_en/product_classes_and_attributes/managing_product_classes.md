When some products in your catalog have certain characteristics in common and need to be handled together as a group, it may be a good idea to configure a product class for them. The process is as follows:

1.  Create a product class (i.e., name this group of products that will be handled together);
2.  Assign the product class you created to specific products (i.e. mark specific products as belonging to this product class).

For more information on managing product classes, see:

*   [Creating product classes](#creating-product-classes);

*   [Viewing your store's product class list](#viewing-your-stores-product-class-list);

*   [Assigning product classes to products](#assigning-product-classes-to-products);

*   [Editing product class names](#editing-product-class-names);

*   [Deleting product classes](#deleting-product-classes).

## Creating Product Classes

When you decide you need to group certain products into a product class, you begin by creating this product class.

To create a new product class:

1.  In your store's Admin area, go to the Classes & attributes section (**Catalog > Classes & attributes**).
2.  Click the **New product class** button:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504877/8719235.png)
    An editable field will appear on a new line in the list of product classes:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504877/8719236.png)
3.  Use the new field to enter a name for the new product class. For example, we will create a product class "Plates":
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504877/8719237.png)
4.  Click **Save changes**:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504877/8719238.png)
    The new product class will be saved and added to the product class list:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504877/8719239.png)

After a product class has been created, you can [assign it to products](#assigning-product-classes-to-products) and, if necessary, {% link "add attributes" ref_kEKoAxJB#adding-product-class-attributes %} for it.

If necessary, you can [edit the product class name](#editing-product-class-names) or [delete the product class](#deleting-product-classes) altogether.

## Viewing Your Store's Product Class List

 If you have any product classes configured in your store, you can view their list in the Classes & attributes section (**Catalog > Classes & attributes**) of your store's Admin area:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504877/8719240.png)

For each product class, you can see the number of products to which it has been assigned.

The list of attributes for each specific product class can be viewed by clicking the Edit attributes (N) link opposite the product class name.

## Assigning Product Classes to Products

To show that a certain product belongs to a certain product class, you need to go to the product's details and assign the product class to it. 

To assign a product class to a product:

1.  In your store's Admin area, find the product to which you want to assign a product class, open its details and click on the** Attributes** tab. We will do this to a product named "Critter Print Melamine Plate 10 inch Set of 4, Orange Cat" (In this example we will assign the product class "Plates" to it):
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504877/8719241.png)
2.  On the page that opens, click the Global link to access the subsection where you can manage the product's global and product class attributes:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504877/8719242.png)
3.  On the page that opens, you will see whether the product already has a product class assigned. In our case, no product class is assigned. To assign a new class, click the **Change** button:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504877/8719243.png)
    This will expand a section with a drop-down box titled **Product class**:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504877/8719244.png)
4.  From the list in the **Product class** drop-down box, select the name of the product class you would like to assign (If an appropriate product class has not yet been created, select the _New product class_ item to add it):
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504877/8719245.png)
5.  Click the **Save changes** button to apply the selected product class name:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504877/8719247.png)
    The product class will be assigned to the product:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504877/8719248.png)

## Editing Product Class Names

It is possible to change the name of a product class.

To rename a product class:

1.  In your store's Admin area, go to the Classes & attributes section (**Catalog > Classes & attributes**).
2.  In the list of product classes, locate the name of the product class that needs to be edited and hover your cursor over the line in the list on which this name is located. An outline of the Product class name field will be displayed:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504877/8719249.png)
3.  Click inside the field containing the product class name and edit the name as you require. 
4.  Once you're done editing, click **Save changes**.
    The product class name will be updated. 

## Deleting Product Classes

It is possible to delete a previously created product class. Deleting a product class removes it from the product class list; any products to which the product class used to be assigned lose the product class and any attributes that were assigned to it via this product class.

To delete a product class:

1.  In your store's Admin area, go to the Classes & attributes section (**Catalog > Classes & attributes**).
2.  In the list of product classes, locate the name of the product class that needs to be deleted and click on the **Trash **icon opposite it. The product class will be marked for deletion.
3.  Click **Save changes**.
    The product class name will be deleted.
