## Adding Product-specific Attributes 

To add a new attribute at the level of a specific product, follow the instructions below:

1.  In your store's Admin area, find the product for which you want to add a new attribute, open its details and click on the** Attributes** tab. We will do this to a product named "Critter Print Melamine Plate 10 inch Set of 4, Orange Cat" (In this example we will add the attribute "Critter print color....Orange" to this product to specify the color of the cat on the plate):
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504853/8719250.png)
    This will open a page where you can manage attributes for this product. Here you can see two subsections: **Product-Specific** and **Global**. Make sure you are viewing the **Product-Specific **section:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504853/8719251.png)
    If you haven't yet added any product-specific attributes for this product, the Product-Specific attributes list will be empty:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504853/8719252.png)
2.  Use the **Add attribute** button to add a field for the new attribute. This is where you will specify your attribute name and value(s). 
    X-Cart supports three types of attribute value fields:

    *   Plain field
    *   Textarea
    *   Yes/No

    You must select the type that best suits your needs (For an explanation of the different attribute value field types, see {% link "Managing attribute values" ref_bTfJ9bTS %}). By default, clicking **Add attribute** creates a Plain field. To select a different field type, click on the "down arrow" expandable part of the **Add attribute **button and select the type you require from the drop-down button menu:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504853/8719253.png)
3.  The new attribute field will appear on a new line in the Product-Specific attributes list. For the sake of example, the snapshot below demonstrates a newly added Plain field:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504853/8719254.png)
4.  Use the field that has been added to specify your attribute's name and value (or, if necessary, multiple values). For the sake of example, we will add the attribute "Critter print color" with the value "Orange":
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504853/8719255.png)
5.  Click **Save changes**. The attribute will be assigned to the product.
    Now if you check the **Specification** tab on the product details page, you will be able to see the attribute you have added:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504853/7602459.png)
    
## Importing Product-specific Attributes

Product specific attributes can be imported in 2 different ways:

1. Via {% link "CSV import: Products" ref_WmJBfwxA %}
   
   Using a products.csv file you'll import products along with the products specific attributes, if they have them. Product specific attribute value column has the format of: `[attribute_name](field:product)`. 
   See the example below:

   ![products-csv.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_d4ktum3z/products-csv.png)
   
   If you want to update a product with product specific attributes only skipping the rest of the product related info (like memberships, productClass, taxClass, enabled, shippable, categories, inventoryTracking, etc.) you'll need to include the sku, name and `[attribute_name](field:product)` fields into your import file only.

2. Via {% link "CSV import: Product attribute values" ref_Z7XdREZl %}
   
   It's also possible to import product specific attributes for products separately. You'll need to use a product-attributes.csv file for the purpose.
   
   See the example below:
   
   ![product-attributes-csv.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_d4ktum3z/product-attributes-csv.png)
   
   The **'owner'** field in a product-attributes.csv file defines whether an attribute is product specific or not. All attributes that have "YES" set in the **'owner'** field are product specific. The actual value of a product specific attribute is defined in the **'value'** field and can vary depending on the **'name'** (the field that is responsibe for a text representation of the attribute). Each actual value of a product specific attribute should be defined in a separate row.
   
   If you want to import the product specific attributes only the required fields for the import file will be **productSKU**, **type**, **name**, **owner** and **value**. 


## Viewing a Product's List of Product-specific Attributes

If a product has any product-specific attributes assigned, you can view their list in the **Product-Specific** section of the **Attributes** tab of the product's details:

    *   To edit the attribute values, edit the **Attribute value** field(s).
4.  Click **Save changes**.
