Product attributes is a special tool that allows a store admin to enhance a basic product description and show a customer more information about a product on the products page. Product attributes can be used in a variaty of ways starting with a simple specification of the product properties and up to multi-value and personalized product options with price and weight modifiers. Product attributes themselves can be enhanced with the {% link "Product Classes" ref_7bb4uhwg %} feature to allow more options for product grouping.
