When it's necessary to create product classes and product class attributes and assign them to multiple products all at once it's good to use import-export feature for the purpose.

There are 3 possible ways to import product classes and product class attributes to your store:
- via a products.csv file ({% link "CSV Import: Products" ref_WmJBfwxA %})
  A products.csv file is a general file for importing all products related info.
- via a product-attributes.csv file ({% link "CSV Import: Product Attribute Values" ref_Z7XdREZl %})
  A product-attributes.csv file is a general file for importing all product attribute related info.
- via an attributes.csv file ({% link "CSV Import: Classes & Attributes" ref_qTbDu6Ov %})
  An attributes.csv file is a file specially intended for importing product classes and related product class attributes.
  
A store admin can get each of the above mentioned files by exporting them using the Export
