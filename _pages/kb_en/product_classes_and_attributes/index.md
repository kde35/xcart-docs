X-Cart {% link "product details" ref_2D8wAeXP %} provide fields for a basic product configuration like product description, price, weight and related that are vital to selling a product online. However, a store admin may find basic product configuration insufficient as sometimes it may be necessary to group products based on some common features other than categories and subcategories or to specify extra product parameters like brand, color, size, technical details, etc. to give customers insight into a product they want to buy or even give customers more product variants to choose from. 

X-Cart has a special Classes and Attributes built-in feature that allows enhancing product properties and gives a store admin more tools to manage products in the store. 

The Products Attributes feature gives a store admin a possibility to add more details to a product description starting from a simple product specification that is displayed in a separate **Product Specification** tab beneath the main product description on the product details page in the storefront and up to various types of product options that enhance the basic product representation.

The Product Classes feature is an extention to product attributes that gives a store admin a possibility to join products in groups other than product categories and subcategories. Product classes can be used along with product attributes only and can help filtering products in the storefront based on particular properties.

The Product Variants feature gives a store admin a possibility to add special product characteristics (like size, color, etc.) to the product description that will give a customer an option to choose a particular variant of one and the same product. Product variants feature is enabled by installing and configuring the [Product Variants](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/product-variants.html "Product Classes and Attributes") addon.
