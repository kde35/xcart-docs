Use the [Hide Prices](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/hide-prices.html "Hide Prices") module if you need to hide prices and disable the shop functionality for non-registered users or any other group of users. Such visitors will be able to browse your online catalog (without the prices), but will not be able to add anything to cart or proceed to checkout.

The addon is included into the X-Cart Ultimate edition and is paid for X-Cart Business and Multivendor.

To install the addon follow the instructions from {% link "Installing addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}

When installed open the addon _Settings page_:
![hide-price-settings.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_46jNUlWG/hide-price-settings.png)

You'll see a screen like this:
![hide-prices-settings-2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_46jNUlWG/hide-prices-settings-2.png)

Here you can select the user types that you want to hide prices from and disable checkout for. 

The visitors that are not allowed to see store prices and checkout will see the storefront like this:
![hide-prices-customer.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_46jNUlWG/hide-prices-customer.png)

Hence they will be forced to sign in/up to buy a product.
