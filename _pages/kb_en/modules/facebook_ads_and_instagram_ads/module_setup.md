## Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads addon Installation
   
To install the **Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads** addon follow the general guides on installing or activating the addon, see the section {% link "Managing addons" ref_gTOegEua %} of this manual.

Once the addon has been activated, a new section will become available in your store's Admin area: **Sales Channels** > **Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads**. 

Also, a new setting - **Add to Facebook product feed** - will be added for each of the products in your store's catalog. You will find it in the **Marketing** section of the product details page. Note that this setting is enabled by default. All the products with the setting **Add to Facebook product feed** enabled will be added automatically to the product feed and uploaded to your Facebook Catalog.

  
##  Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads addon Setup

You can configure the addon settings in the **Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads** section of the store's Admin area (**Sales Channels** > **Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads**).

  * **Include out of stock products into feed** : Enable this option if you need the out-of-stock products to be included into the feed that is submitted to Facebook and Instagram.

  The system will take some time to generate a Product Feed URL depending on the overall store inventory. Once the process is completed, copy the _Product Feed URL_ that has been generated and paste it into the appropriate field when specifying a source of products for your catalog (https://www.facebook.com/products/catalogs/new).

  {% note info %}
  The _Frequency of Product Feed renewal_ setting itself will not make renewals automatical. You will need to {% link "configure your server to run scheduled X-Cart tasks" ref_lLqNzAaq %}.
