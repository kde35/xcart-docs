## Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads addon Installation
   
To start using the addon **Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads**, you need to make sure it is installed and enabled. General addon installation and activation instructions can be found in the section {% link "Managing addons" ref_gTOegEua %} of this manual.

Once the addon has been activated, a new section will become available in your store's Admin area: **Sales Channels** > **Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads**. 

Also, a new setting - **Add to Facebook product feed** - will be added for each of the products in your store's catalog. You will find it in the **Marketing** section of the product details page. Note that this setting is enabled by default. All the products with the setting **Add to Facebook product feed** enabled will be added automatically to the product feed and uploaded to your Facebook Catalog.
