Social feeds are a good point to attract new visitors and boost sales, Facebook Marketing being one of the most popular and efficient. If you have a Facebook account, you can start using X-Cart's free [Facebook Ads and Instagram Ads](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/facebook-e-commerce.html) addon (formerly known as "Facebook eCommerce") right away. This addon enables you to upload your products to Facebook Catalog and to create personalized ads that will allow reaching the right audience in the right place at the right time. Facebook ads are synchronized with Instagram and are shown there as well even if you don't have an Instagram account.

You can learn more about Instagram ads [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1634705703469129?helpref=faq_content) and [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1513393428972189?helpref=faq_content). 

If you do not have a Facebook account yet, you can create it at [https://www.facebook.com/business](https://www.facebook.com/business).

The addon Facebook Ads and Instagram Ads uploads your products to Facebook Catalog automatically and syncs the product data always keeping the catalog up-to-date. 

To make use of Facebook and Instagram ads, you will need to:

Once the addon has been activated, a new section will become available in your store's Admin area: **Sales Channels** > **Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads**. 

Also, a new setting - **Add to Facebook product feed** - will be added for each of the products in your store's catalog. You will find it in the Marketing section of the product details page. Note that this setting is enabled by default. All the products with the setting **Add to Facebook product feed** enabled will be added automatically to the product feed and uploaded to your Facebook Catalog.

## Configure the addon 

  You can configure the addon settings in the Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads section of the store's Admin area (**Sales Channels** > **Facebook Ads & Instagram Ads**). 
  
  ![settings-page-new.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_LA0TBHEA/settings-page-new.png)
  
  Note that this section can also be accessed via the **Settings** link in the **My addons** section:
  
  ![xc5_fb_module_settings_link.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_LA0TBHEA/xc5_fb_module_settings_link.png)
  
  To configure the addon, adjust the following settings:
  
  * **Frequency of Product Feed renewal** (hourly/daily/weekly): Specify how often you would like your product feed to be renewed. 
  * **Include out of stock products into feed** : Enable this option if you need the out-of-stock products to be included into the feed that is submitted to Facebook and Instagram.
  * **Facebook Pixel ID** : Specify your Facebook Pixel ID. If you do not have a Facebook Pixel ID yet, you can generate it as described at [https://www.facebook.com/business/help/952192354843755](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/952192354843755). Facebook Pixel will enable the tracking of such events as _View Content/Search/Add to Cart/Initiate Checkout/Purchase_, and you will be able to get stats on these events to work with sales funnel, ads conversion and so on.
  
  Be sure to save your settings by clicking **Save changes**.
  
  {% note info %}
  Use the {% link "Google Product Feed" ref_2gQBB6qM %} addon to expand the data values that are submitted to the feed. In case the Google Product Feed addon is installed and enabled and the hidden/global/class attributes are assigned to to Google groups, the feed generated by the Facebook Adds & Instagram Ads addon will also include the hidden/global/class attribute values set up for the Google Product feed.
  {% endnote %}
  
  After the settings have been properly adjusted, you can click the **Generate Product Feed** button to get a link for uploading the product feed to your Facebook Catalog.
  
  ![generate-feed-new.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_LA0TBHEA/generate-feed-new.png)
  
  The system will take some time to generate a Product Feed URL depending on the overall store inventory. Once the process is completed, copy the _Product Feed URL_ that has been generated and paste it into the appropriate field when specifying a source of products for your catalog (https://www.facebook.com/products/catalogs/new).
  
  ![copy-feed-new.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_LA0TBHEA/copy-feed-new.png)
  
  {% note info %}
  The _Frequency of Product Feed renewal_ setting itself will not make renewals automatical. You will need to {% link "configure your server to run scheduled X-Cart tasks" ref_lLqNzAaq %}.
  {% endnote %}
