Instagram is now turning into a popular platform for online shopping by integration with the Facebook Catalog feature. With shopping on Instagram, you can share featured products through your posts and Stories, or have people discover your products in Search & Explore.

{% note info %}
As selling in Instagram is a brand-new feature which is still in its immature phase, there might be continuous updates coming up in the future.  If you have any questions or problems in getting it work, we suggest you trying to contact Instagram or Facebook support teams for help.

To successfully connect your Ecwid store to Instagram: 

1) add your store to Facebook, 
2) make your Instagram account a business profile 
3) connect Instagram to your Facebook page. 

Once complete, Instagram will review your account before granting access to the feature.

You can learn more about Instagram ads [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1634705703469129?helpref=faq_content) and [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1513393428972189?helpref=faq_content). 


1. Change your Instagram profile to a business profile and link to your business Facebook page.

  1.1 Open Instagram on your mobile, go to your Profile  in the bottom right corner.

  1.2 Choose Switch to Business Profile and select the Facebook page you'd like to associate with your Business Profile on Instagram with. Make sure your profile is set to Public as Private accounts can't switch to Business Accounts.

  1.3 On the Set Up Your Business Profile page, review your business's contact information, make any changes and tap Done.

Note: Currently, a Business Profile on Instagram can only be connected to a single Facebook Page.

3. Getting approved by Instagram.

Once you complete the above requirements, your Instagram business profile will be reviewed for access to the shopping feature. Usually, the review process takes a few days but sometimes it can take longer if the Instagram team needs to look into more details. There is no need to apply for the approval. If your account is approved, you will receive a notification on your Instagram business profile. A step we found confusing is that Instagram doesn't provide any indication that the approval process is in process so we just had to wait and check.  Once approved you'll see a Shopping option when you go to Settings in your Instagram App. If you don't see Shopping under Business Settings, your account either is still under review or it hasn't been approved for shopping on Instagram. Please contact Instagram for further assistance.

 

4. Tag products in your posts on Instagram.

  4.1 Tap  to go to your Profile. Tap the Get Started alert at the top of your Profile. If you don't see the alert in the image above, tap -> Shopping -> Continue -> Select a Product Catalog to connect to your Instagram Business Profile -> click Done.

  4.2 To tag products in your posts: Select a photo and add a caption, effects and filters -> Tap the product in the photo that you want to tag -> Enter the name of the product you want to tag, then select it as it appears in the search box -> Click Done -> Click Share.
  
  4.3 When your post with tagged products has been approved, your audiences would be able to see the product name and pricing when viewing the post. When clicking into the product tag, they will see a more detailed product page on Instagram with information retrieved from your Google Shopping feed, including

An image of the product from your post.
A description of the product.
How much the product costs.
A link that takes them directly to your Rocketspark shop, where they can purchase the product. 
They will be directed to the product page in your Rocketpark shop when clicking View on website and make a purchase on your Rocketspark website. 

When someone taps a product tag on your post or a product sticker in your story, they'll be taken to a product description page where they will see:

* An image of the product from your post
* A product description
* The product price
* A link to the product page in your X-Cart based store, where they can purchase the product

Note:

You can tag products in both new and existing posts from your Instagram business profile. You can tag up to 5 products per single-image post or 20 products per multi-image post.
You can edit or delete products you've tagged in single image posts on Instagram, but keep in mind that for multi-image posts, you can't edit or delete tagged products once your post has been published. 
If you delete a product that's associated with your business profile, the associated tag will be removed from any posts the product is tagged in.
