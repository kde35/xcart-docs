Instagram Shopping is now turning into a popular platform for online shopping by integration with the Facebook Catalog feature and 

With shopping on Instagram, you can share featured products through your posts and Stories, or have people discover your products in Search & Explore.

When someone taps a product tag on your post or a product sticker in your story, they'll be taken to a product description page where they will see:

* An image of the product from your post
* A product description
* The product price
* A link to the product page in your X-Cart based store, where they can purchase the product

To successfully connect your Ecwid store to Instagram: 

1) add your store to Facebook, 
2) make your Instagram account a business profile 
3) connect Instagram to your Facebook page. 

Once complete, Instagram will review your account before granting access to the feature.
