Instagram is now turning into a popular platform for online shopping by integration with the Facebook Catalog feature. With shopping on Instagram, you can share featured products through your posts and Stories, or have people discover your products in Search & Explore.

{% note info %}
As selling in Instagram is a brand-new feature which is still in its immature phase, there might be continuous updates coming up in the future.  If you have any questions or problems in getting it work, we suggest you trying to contact Instagram or Facebook support teams for help.

## Instagram Shopping Requirements and Availability

If you want to sell goods in Instagram make sure you are eligible for Instagram Shopping first:

1. Your business must be located in a [supported market](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/321000045119159?helpref=faq_content "Instagram Shopping"). 
2. You must sell physical goods (not services or egoods)
3. You must comply with the Facebook [commerce policies](https://www.facebook.com/policies/commerce?ref=fbb_ig_shopping_setup# "Instagram Shopping")
4. Your Instagram account must be set up as a business profile (free to set up)
5. You must have a {% link "product catalog" ref_1LQyHRCO %} associated with a shop on Facebook

## Connecting X-Cart to Instagram

To successfully connect your X-Cart store to Instagram: 

1. Add your store to Facebook as described in {% link "Product Feed Generation and Upload to Facebook" ref_1LQyHRCO %}, 

2. Change your Instagram profile to a business profile and link to your business Facebook page.

   * Open Instagram on your mobile, go to your **Profile** in the bottom right corner.

   * Choose **Switch to Business Profile** and select the Facebook page you'd like to associate with your Business Profile on Instagram with. Make sure your profile is set to **Public** as Private accounts can't switch to Business Accounts.

   * On the **Set Up Your Business Profile** page, review your business's contact information, make any changes and tap **Done**.
     
     {% note info %}
     Currently, a Business Profile on Instagram can only be connected to a single Facebook Page.

3. Getting approved by Instagram.

   Once you complete the above requirements, your Instagram business profile will be reviewed for access to the shopping feature. Usually, the review process takes a few days but sometimes it can take longer if the Instagram team needs to look into more details. There is no need to apply for the approval. If your account is approved, you will receive a notification on your Instagram business profile. Instagram doesn't provide any indication that the approval process is in process so just wait and check.  Once approved you'll see a **Shopping** option when you go to **Settings** in your Instagram App. If you don't see **Shopping** under **Business Settings**, your account either is still under review or it hasn't been approved for shopping on Instagram. Please contact Instagram for further assistance if this is a case.

 4. Tag products in your posts on Instagram (once you get your approval from Instagram).
    
    * Tap to go to your **Profile**. Tap the **Get Started** alert at the top of your **Profile**. If you don't see the alert in the image above, tap **Shopping** -> **Continue** -> **Select a Product Catalog** to connect to your Instagram Business Profile. Click **Done** when a product catalog is connected.

    * To tag products in your posts: 
      * Select a photo and add a caption, effects and filters 
      * Tap the product in the photo that you want to tag 
      * Enter the name of the product you want to tag, then select it as it appears in the search box 
      * Click **Done**
      * Click **Share**.
      
      {% note info %}
      You can tag products in both new and existing posts from your Instagram business profile. You can tag up to 5 products per single-image post or 20 products per multi-image post.
      
      You can edit or delete products you've tagged in single image posts on Instagram, but keep in mind that for multi-image posts, you can't edit or delete tagged products once your post has been published. 
      
      If you delete a product from your Facebook Catalog that's associated with your business profile, the associated tag will be removed from any posts the product is tagged in.
      {% endnote %}
  

When someone taps a product tag on your post or a product sticker in your story, they'll be taken to a product description page where they will see:
* An image of the product from your post.
* A description of the product.
* A product price.
* A link **View on website** that takes them directly to your X-Cart store, where they can purchase the product. 
        
When you tag products on your posts and add product stickers on your stories, you'll be able to view insights on how people interact with your shopping content. This set of insights measures how often people view and interact with products tagged in a post or with a product sticker in a story.
