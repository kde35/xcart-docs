## Product Feed Generation

Once the addon is set up you can proceed to the product feed generation.
  
For this purpose:

1. Click the **Generate Product Feed** button to get a link for uploading the product feed to your Facebook Catalog.

   {% note info %}
   Use the {% link "Google Product Feed" ref_2gQBB6qM %} addon to expand the data values that are submitted to the feed. In case the Google Product Feed addon is installed and enabled and the hidden/global/class attributes are assigned to Google groups, the feed generated by the Facebook Adds & Instagram Ads addon will also include the hidden/global/class attribute values set up for the Google Product feed.
   {% endnote %}
   
   The system will take some time to generate a Product Feed URL depending on the overall store inventory. 

2. Once the process is completed, copy the _Product Feed URL_ that has been generated and paste it into the appropriate field when specifying a source of products for your catalog (https://www.facebook.com/products/catalogs/new).

   {% note info %}
   The _Frequency of Product Feed renewal_ setting itself will not make renewals automatical. You will need to {% link "configure your server to run scheduled X-Cart tasks" ref_lLqNzAaq %}.
   {% endnote %}
