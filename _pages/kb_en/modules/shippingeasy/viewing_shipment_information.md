When an order is shipped, ShippingEasy sends shipment related information back to your X-Cart store. This includes information about the carrier used, the shipping cost and the tracking number assigned to the shipment. In X-Cart this information is written to the **Staff note** section of the order details. The tracking number for the order is written to the **Tracking number** field of the order details. Here's what it looks like on the Order details page:
