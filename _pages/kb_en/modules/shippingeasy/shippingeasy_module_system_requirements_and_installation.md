To be able to successfully install and use the ShippingEasy addon, you need a working copy of X-Cart 5 installed on your server.

For correct operation, the addon requires the {% link "SEO-friendly URLs" ref_nJxrzFEZ %} feature to be enabled at your store. 

The addon can be obtained via X-Cart’s Marketplace.

To install and enable the addon on your system, follow the general addon installation instructions. See {% link "Installing Addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

As a result, you should have the module ShippingEasy listed in your store's Installed Addons section (**Extensions > Installed modules**).
