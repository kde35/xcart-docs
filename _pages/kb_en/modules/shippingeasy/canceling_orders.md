When an order gets canceled in X-Cart (i.e. gets the payment status "Cancelled" or "Declined"), the ShippingEasy integration sends an order cancellation request to ShippingEasy. As a result, the respective order in ShippingEasy is removed. The process is fully automated, so you do not have to do the cancellation on the ShippingEasy end manually.
