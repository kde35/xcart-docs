You can configure your X-Cart 5 store to show a section recommending related products (alternatives or additional items) to your customers - the so-called "Related Products" block. This feature is available through the use of the module **Related Products** by X-Cart team. To use the feature, make sure this module is {% link "installed and enabled" ref_uEnDBBA7 %}.

By using the related products feature you can: 
* encourage the customer viewing a product to spend more money by buying a more expensive alternative to the product being viewed;
* remind the customer about other popular things in which they may be interested (extensions, accessories, warranties, etc.) or recommend related products from other categories; 
* display recommended items in the Add to Cart popup (This requires the addon "Add to Cart Popup").

Here is an example of "Related products" block displayed at the bottom of the product page for one of the products in our demo store:
![xc5_products_related_products.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4a5rpsQq/xc5_products_related_products.png)

And here is an example of how related products can be used as a source of items for "Customers who bought this also bought" in the Add to Cart popup:

(More info on how to enable this feature can be found in the section {% link "Add to Cart PopUp Module" ref_1iGC8Efj %})

## Adding Related Products
To add related products:

1. In the Products section of your store's Admin area (**Catalog** -> **Products**), find the product for which you need to add one or more related products and open its details. Go to the Related products tab.

2. Click **Add related products**. You will see a popup with a list of products to select your related products from.

3. Select the product(s) that you want to be related to the product you are working on. If necessary, use the filter above the list to find the product(s) you require.

4. Set the check box option **Make bidirectional relations** at the bottom of the list as you require. (If the option **Make bidirectional relations** is enabled, the products selected from the list will both be linked from and provide a link to the main product. If the option **Make bidirectional relations** is disabled, the products selected from the list will be linked to from the main product, but will not provide a link to it.)   

5. Click **Add products**.
