The addon iDEAL Payments by X-Cart team provides a low-cost and virtually risk-free real-time payment method to accept online payments in the Netherlands. Developed by a Dutch banking community, iDEAL gives your customers a trusted, secure and simple method of payment, using their own familiar online banking environment. An iDEAL payment is guaranteed and cannot be reversed (chargeback is not available).

To use iDEAL Payments, you will need to complete the iDEAL application process. You can start by choosing the "Registration" link at [https://ideal.rabobank.nl](https://ideal.rabobank.nl). The process involves providing the required information about you business and completing some tests in the Rabobank iDEAL test environment. After the assessment and approval of your application and signing your contract, you will be able to activate iDEAL on your site. The guidelines for completing the application process are available [here](https://ideal.rabobank.nl/ideal/languagechange.do?languageid=er&RND_FORM_TOKEN=RND_1460629246265_-682106363&guilanguageaction=true).
