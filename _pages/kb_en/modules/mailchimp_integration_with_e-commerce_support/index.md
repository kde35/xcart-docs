[Mailchimp](http://www.mailchimp.com/signup/?pid=xcart&source=website) integration for X-Cart 5 is available in the form of an add-on module (“addon”) named “Mailchimp Integration with Ecommerce support”. 
It is a powerful tool that replaces X-Cart's built-in newsletter subscriptions feature and enables you to access some exciting e-commerce features like product recommendations, abandoned cart messages, purchase-based automations, and sales reports.
