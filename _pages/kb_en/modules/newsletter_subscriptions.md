The addon is included in all X-Cart editions (Business, Multivendor and Ultimate) and comes preinstalled. If it is not, follow the instructions from {% link "Activating and Deactivating Addons" ref_uEnDBBA7 %} to enable it.

All email addresses submitted via this form are added to your store’s list of newsletter subscribers available in the **Sales channels** -> **Newsletters** section of the Admin area where they can be managed by the administrator.

{% note info %}
If the default Newsletter subscriptions addon is linked to {% link "Mailchimp" ref_Rox8AcJp %} the subscriber email addresses submitted via the subscription form will no longer be stored to a list within X-Cart, but will be handled via Mailchimp, provided that your X-Cart store is connected to your Mailchimp account via the addon settings, and the Mailchimp Integration is configured properly.
{% endnote%}

The **Newsletters** section of the Admin area allows a store admin to add new emails to the subscribtion list and export existing subscribers into a .csv file.

To add a new email to the list click **Create** button and type in the required email.

To export the subscribers list select the required emails from the list and click **Export selected: CSV** or don't select anything and click **Export all: CSV** if you need to export all the emails.
