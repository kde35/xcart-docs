[Catalog](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/catalog.html "Catalog") addon turns your online store into a catalog of your goods and services. It disables checkout, the cart icon and removes the "Add to cart" and "Buy" buttons. Customers can browse your products and see their prices, but the checkout is not available for them.

To install the addon follow the guides from {% link "Installing Addons from the X-Cart App Store" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

Once the addon has been installed, checkout is disabled, and store visitors are not allowed to buy any products.
