The addon [Product Advisor](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/product-advisor.html "Product Advisor") allows you to add several blocks promoting your products to customers:

* **New Arrivals** — lists recently added products.
* **Coming Soon** — informs about products which sales will start soon.
* **Recently Viewed** — lets your customers quickly open the page of a product they have viewed before.
* **Who Viewed This Also Bought** and **Who Purchased This Also Bought** — advise which other products may interest customers viewing the product page.

You can choose which blocks to display in the store front, specify the maximum number of products to show in the blocks and configure how long products are considered new (in days). Also, the addon marks “New” and “Coming Soon” products on the storefront with corresponding labels.
