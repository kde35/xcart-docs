To be able to successfully install and use the addon "Booking", you need a working copy of X-Cart 5 installed on your server.

The addon can be obtained via X-Cart’s Marketplace.

To install and enable the addon on your system, follow the general module installation instructions. See {% link "Installing modules from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

As a result, you should have the addon "Booking" listed in your store's Installed Modules section:

If you want your bookable products to have variants, you also need to make sure the addon "{% link "Product Variants" ref_0uApuQfx %}" is enabled.
