A [Tax Exempt module](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/tax-exemption.html "Tax Exempt") by X-Cart makes it possible to add tax exemptions for certain groups of customers as well as for particular products.

To start using the module install it as described in {% link "Installing addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

When installed and enabled proceed to the Tax exempt module settings page:

![installed.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6dA6W1gY/installed.png)

Here you can enable/disable the **Allow customers to modify their tax number after tax exemption is enabled** option. 

![settings-page.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6dA6W1gY/settings-page.png)

This option defines whether customers can modify their tax number after tax exemption has been enabled in their profile. You may want to keep this option disabled to prevent customers from changing their tax numbers without your knowing.

This option works only if the field 'Tax number' is enabled for customer user profiles via General settings->User Profiles options and the option 'Enable tax exemption for customers' is enabled.
