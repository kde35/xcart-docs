Customer reviews are a real force in promoting your goods to the rest of the store visitors (as long as the review rates are high). But have you ever thought of extending your customer reviews all over the web to attract more and more new customers?

Consider integrating your store with [Shopper Approved](https://www.shopperapproved.com/) to collect and manage Merchant, Product and Local reviews in a convenient and efficient manner. Shopper Approved is a seller rating extension trying to help businesses develop a positive image through customer ratings. This cloud-based extension provides clients with the ability to improve customer engagement and improve brand image by displaying customer reviews on the product, merchant, and local listings (Google, Yahoo, Bing, CitySearch, Facebook, Youtube, etc). All reviews are collected from real customers of Shopper Approved clients that have had a confirmed purchase experience with that company.

Additionally, Shopper Approved enables businesses to send review invitations via email to existing customers. This allows you to gain insight from repeat and loyal clientsâ€™ reviews so you can further enhance the services. 

X-Cart is integrated with Shopper Approved via an [addon of the same name](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/shopper-approved-reviews.html).  Since Shopper Approved uses a Google data feed, you will also need the addon [Google Product Feed](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/google-product-feed.html) to be installed and enabled.
