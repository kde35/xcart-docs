Adding a downloadable product is similar to adding an ordinary product. The only difference is that when you configure a downloadable product you must assign a downloadable file to it and - as the product will not require physical shipping - disable shipping for it.

Here's how to configure a downloadable product from the store back end (Admin area or - in the case of X-Cart Multivendor - Vendor area):
1. Create a new product or find an existing product that you wish to turn into a downloadable one. 
2. On the **Info** tab of the Product details, locate the section **Shipping** and disable shipping for the product.

3. Go to the **Attachments** tab and assign a file to the product.
  ![attachments.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_3sGGx0lV/attachments.png)
  You can upload files from your local computer, from your local server or via an external URL. For example, it is possible to use a shareable URL pointing to a file in a storage like One Drive, DropBox, or Google Drive.
4. Save the changes.
