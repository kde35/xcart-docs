## Adding Downloadable Products
Adding a downloadable product is similar to adding an ordinary product. The only difference is that when you configure a downloadable product you must assign one or more downloadable files to it and, as the product will not require physical shipping, disable shipping for it.

Here's how to configure a downloadable product from the store back end (Admin area or - in the case of X-Cart Multivendor - Vendor area):

1. Create a new product or find an existing product that you wish to turn into a downloadable one. 

2. On the **Info** tab of the Product details, locate the section **Shipping** and disable shipping for the product. Be sure to save your changes.

3. Go to the **Attachments** tab and assign a file to the product.

   You can upload files from your local computer, from your local server or via an external URL.

   For example, it is possible to use a shareable URL pointing to a file in a storage like One Drive, DropBox, or Google Drive.
   
   Once the file has been uploaded, it will be added to the list of attachments for the product.

   If necessary, you will be able to delete or change the attachment file at any time later.
   
4. Adjust the file settings as you require.

5. Save the changes.

Note that it is possible to create downloadable products by cloning existing products in your store catalog or by import:
   * {% link "Cloning Products" ref_5gTzBmtP %}
   * {% link "CSV Import: Products" ref_WmJBfwxA %}

## Managing Downloadable Product Attachments
Attachments associated with a downloadable product can be managed via the Attachments tab of the product details:
