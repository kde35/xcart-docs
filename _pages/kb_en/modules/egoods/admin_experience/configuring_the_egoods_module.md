To start using the module E-goods in an X-Cart 5 store, the store administrator needs to enable (activate) it. General instructions for module activation can be found in the section {% link "Activating and deactivating addons" ref_uEnDBBA7 %} of this manual.

Once the module has been enabled, the store administrator must adjust the module settings via the module _Settings_ page.

The following settings can be adjusted:

* **Download link TTL (days)**: Specify the number of days that a buyer of a downloadable product should be able to use the product download link provided to them. To allow unlimited access, set this value to zero. **Important**: The "Download link TTL" setting does not apply to Amazon Signed URLs. If a downloadable product file is stored on Amazon S3, the Amazon Signed URL will be available for 7 days; we have no control of that. The link availability in this case, however, can be restricted using the setting "Downloads limit (per 1 ordered item)" below.

* **Downloads limit (per 1 ordered item)**: Secify the number of product download attempts that should be available to the buyer (i.e. how many times the buyer of a downloadable product should be able to download the product using the download link provided to them). To allow unlimited access, set this value to zero. If you are using Amazon Signed URLs, this settings controls the limit of link renewal, because it is impossible to control downloads on the Signed URL.

* **Keep a history of downloads**: Amazon S3 Signed URLs are counted per link access (not download), because X-Cart cannot track downloads on the Amazon S3 Storage.

* **Show only ESD related fulfilment statuses**: With this option enabled, your store will use only three fulfilment statuses for all orders: _New_, _Delivered_ and _Will Not Deliver_. You can rename the statuses as you require using the {% link "Custom order statuses" ref_7FIU2sxJ %} module

* **Approve before providing access to download**: If enabled, a customer will get a download link for the product only after an order is paid and the order fulfilment status is changed from _Waiting for approve_ to any other (except for _Will not deliver_). If disabled, a customer will get a download link as soon as the orders is paid, the order fulfilment status will be preset to _NEW_.

To facilitate the download of large file attachments (100 Mb and larger) by customers, use X-Sendfile. To do so, contact your hosting provider to make sure X-Sendfile is installed on the server and configure your X-Cart installation to support large file downloads. For details, see the section {% link "Configuring your X-Cart server for better large file download performance" ref_yCxquUhl %}. 

Alternatively, use Amazon S3 Signed URLs. See the section {% link "Configuring Amazon S3 Signed URLs" ref_51iHbWYa %} for more info.
