The X-Cart 5 module E-goods enables you to sell digitally distributed content (also known as digital goods / e-goods / digital distribution products). Installing this module does not prevent you from selling tangible products in the same online store.

The module E-goods extends the functionality of the module [**File Attachments**](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/file-attachments.html "E-goods") and allows you to specify whether a file uploaded for a product can be downloaded from the product page at any time freely, or can be downloaded only after the product has been purchased. On top of that, the module makes use of X-Cart's memberships feature allowing you to restrict customer access to specific files based on customer membership; this can be used to provide different files to different membership levels.


The module helps you to combat piracy by limiting the number of days that a download link should be active and the number of times this link can be used by customers.
