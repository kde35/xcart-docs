The X-Cart 5 module E-goods enables you to sell digitally distributed content (also known as digital goods / e-goods / digital distribution products). Installing this module does not prevent you from selling tangible products in the same online store.

The module E-goods extends the functionality of the module [**File Attachments**](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/file-attachments.html "E-goods") and allows you to specify whether a file uploaded for a product can be downloaded from the product page at any time freely, or can be downloaded only after the product has been purchased.
