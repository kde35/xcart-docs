You can find out whether your X-Cart store has the addon Shopper Approved Reviews installed and enabled by checking the **My addons** section of your store Admin area. If not, the addon can be obtained via the X-Cart App Store.

To install the addon, follow the steps described in {% link "Installing and Activating Addons" ref_0fGEpvrh %}.

Before you start using the addon, you need to adjust the addon settings. Proceed to the Shopper Approved Reviews addon settings page: 
![settings.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_3otm3RBq/settings.png)

There you will be prompted to either sign up for Shopper Approved or to connect manually with your existing Shopper Approved account.
![settings-page.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_3otm3RBq/settings-page.png)

If you do not have a Shopper Approved account yet, you can hit **Sign Up**, and the system will automatically create a Shopper Approved account for you and link your X-Cart store to it. Please note, however, that in this case your credentials for access to the Shopper Approved dashboard will be sent to your main Site administrator email address as configured via the **Site administrator e-mails** setting in the Contact information section (**Store setup** -> **Contact information**) of your X-Cart store Admin area. Make sure this setting {% link "has been adjusted properly" ref_wKcxbiUf %}; otherwise you will not be able to get your Shopper Approved dashboard credentials.

If you have an existing Shopper Approved account, you can connect it to your X-Cart store by hitting the button **'Connect with existing account'** and providing the required connection information manually.

You will need to specify the following information:

   * **ShopperApproved Site ID**: Get this info in the ShopperApproved Dashboard -> [User Info section](https://www.shopperapproved.com/account/dashboard/userinfo/account-settings "Configuring the Shopper Approved") 
   * **ShopperApproved API Token**: Get this info in the ShopperApproved Dashboard -> [User Info section](https://www.shopperapproved.com/account/dashboard/userinfo/account-settings "Configuring the Shopper Approved") 
   * **ShopperApproved Site Domain**: Enter your X-Cart store URL; for example, myxcartstore.com

Once enabled, the Shopper Approved Reviews addon creates a static page titled _Read our reviews_; that page is aimed at promoting verified reviews you gain through the Shopper Approved addon. You can customize it to your liking in the **Content** -> **Pages** section of the Admin area or add the merchant reviews widget to any other static page. The _Read our reviews_ static page may appear empty until you receive your first reviews and approve them via the Shopper Approved dashboard.

Further addon setup can be done in the **Content** -> **Shopper Approved** section of your X-Cart store Admin area.

The settings that you can configure in the Product and Category pages tab are as follows:
* **Use Shopper Approved widget instead of the default one**: If this option is enabled, the widget will display the reviews submitted via the Shopper Approved addon only; any reviews submitted earlier will not be available to customers.
* **Star size**: Regular/Big
* **Maximum number of reviews to display**: Specify the number of reviews you require (from 3 to 20).
* **Date format**: Select the date format you require. 

Once you are done configuring the settings, be sure to save your changes. 

More settings are available under the **Product** -> **Code** section of your [ShopperApproved](https://www.shopperapproved.com/account/product/page-code "Configuring the Shopper Approved") dashboard at “Step 2. Select Your Options”.

The _Merchant Review Survey_ tab allows you to enable/disable a brief survey on the thank you page and a necessity of mandatory comments. More settings are available under the **Merchant** -> **Surveys** section of your [ShopperApproved](https://www.shopperapproved.com/account/merchant/surveys/options "Configuring the Shopper Approved") dashboard where you can set up follow-up emails survey to all customers who check out.

Since ShopperApproved uses the {% link "Google feed" ref_2gQBB6qM %} data format, you will need to install and enable the Google Product Feed addon and generate a data feed using it. The data feed will be automatically imported to ShopperApproved, and you can find a link to it in the **Dashboard** -> **Product** -> **Integration** section at [ShopperApproved](https://www.shopperapproved.com/account/product/integration "Configuring the Shopper Approved"). 

![sa-data-feed.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_3otm3RBq/sa-data-feed.png)

Once the Google data feed is submitted to ShopperApproved, your product reviews become available in the [dashboard](https://www.shopperapproved.com/account/dashboard "Configuring the Shopper Approved") where you can manage them further.

Afterwards the reviews will be updated automatically every time you re-generate the Google feed in X-Cart.

After placing an order at your X-Cart store, customers will be prompted to provide feedback. They will see a pop-up screen where they will be able to rate their customer experience and answer the survey questions:
