* **Number of exported products per step**: Specify the number of products that should be exported per one step of the feed generation process. The default value is 100.

* **Direct download links**: If this option is enabled, the feed will be generated as direct download links. Direct download links require that correct file permissions should be set on the folder "[xc5]/var/feeds/". If the option "Direct download links" is disabled, the feed generation will be done through a download script.
