To generate product feeds:

1.  In your store's Admin area, go to the Product feeds page (**Catalog > Product feeds**):
    ![pf-1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_20WzfB4m/pf-1.png)

2.  Select the shopping engines for which you want to export your products.
    ![pf-2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_20WzfB4m/pf-2.png)

3.  Click **Generate selected feeds**. The addon will start generating the selected feeds.

While X-Cart is generating the feeds, the page will display a progress bar instead of the list of supported shopping engines:

![progress-bar.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_20WzfB4m/progress-bar.png)

Closing the browser tab will pause the process till you return to this page.

Once all the selected feeds have been generated, download links for the generated feeds will be provided in the list of supported shopping engines:

![pf-3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_20WzfB4m/pf-3.png)

For better results, we recommend you analyze the feeds that were generated and tweak them in a spreadsheet program before submitting them to a shopping engine.
