To start using the addon CloudSearch & CloudFilters, enable it in the section **My addons** of your store's Admin area. 
![cloud_module.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_7qk2On7k/cloud_module.png)

To enable the addon, follow the instructions from the section {% link "Installing and activating addons" ref_0fGEpvrh %} of this manual.

After the addon has been enabled, your 30-day free trial of CloudSearch is started automatically. You can view your current CloudSearch trial status or upgrade to paid service via the [CloudSearch Dashboard](https://kb.x-cart.com/modules/cloudsearch/understanding_cloudsearch.html#cloudsearch-dashboard).

Note that if you are going to use the CloudFilters component along with CloudSearch, you will want to enable the use of CloudFilters from the CloudSearch settings page. This will launch your 30-day free trial of CloudFilters. Instructions on how to enable and configure CloudFilters in your store are available in the section {% link "Configuring and Using CloudFilters" ref_25POvGjV %}. After enabling CloudFilters, you can play with the filtering system on your store site for the duration of the entire free trial period or upgrade to paid service via the [CloudFilters settings page](https://kb.x-cart.com/modules/cloudsearch/cloudfilters.html#cloudfilters-dashboard).
