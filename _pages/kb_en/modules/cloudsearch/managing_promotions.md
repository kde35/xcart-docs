Promotions is a feature available to users on paid accounts. It allows the store administrator to promote specific products by prioritizing them among the search results for certain queries. To create a promotion, the administrator selects a product and links it to a query. As a result, the product appears on the first line of search results in the Products section of the CloudSearch widget.

# Creating Promotions

Let us imagine that you are selling smartphones and want to promote, for example, iPhones (all of them, or just a certain SKU). 

Here's how you can create a promotion:

1. In the store’s Admin area, go to the **Catalog** -> **CloudSearch & Cloudfilters** section, locate the **Promotions** tab and click **Add Promotion**:
   ![prom-1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0OurnBzC/prom-1.png)
  
   A popup window titled "Add product promotion" will be displayed:
   ![prom-2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0OurnBzC/prom-2.png)
    
2. In the “Add product promotion” popup window, select the product that you want to be promoted:
  
  Click inside the “Product” field and start typing the product name or SKU. The module will provide search results as you type. As soon as you see the item you require, click on its name and the product will be added:
  ![prom-3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0OurnBzC/prom-3.png)
  
3. Specify one or more search queries for which the selected product should be listed in the topmost position of search results in the Products section of the CloudSearch widget:
  ![prom-4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0OurnBzC/prom-4.png)
  
  To enter multiple search queries, separate the individual queries with commas (,) or press ENTER after each query as you type.
    
4. Click **Create promotion**.

The promotion has been created. You should be able to see it in the **Promotions** list:
  ![prom-6.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0OurnBzC/prom-6.png)

Now if you visit the store front end and do a search for "iphone" or "6splus" or any other key from the list, you should be able to see a link to iPhone 6S Plus on the first line of search results under "Products":
  ![prom-res.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0OurnBzC/prom-res.png)

If you decide to add more search queries to the product later on, just type them next to ones you have added previously and save the changes.

# Setting the order of promotions in search results

If you choose to configure multiple promotions for the same search query, you will be able to adjust the order in which the promotions should be displayed in the search results inside the CloudSearch widget in your store’s front end. 

Use arrows to move a promotion up or down:

![prom-sort.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0OurnBzC/prom-sort.png)

The new order will be saved automatically.

# Deleting promotions

You can delete any promotion you no longer need. 
For this purpose locate the promotion in question and click the trash icon:

![trash-1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0OurnBzC/trash-1.png)

Then confirm your decision in a pop-up:

![trash-2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0OurnBzC/trash-2.png)
