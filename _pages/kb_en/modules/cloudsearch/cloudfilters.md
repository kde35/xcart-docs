CloudFilters module is aimed at narrowing down search results and helping your customers to navigate through a large list of products to find items matching certain filtering criteria. Filters will be dynamically adjusted to your customers' needs, automatically updating the count values to reflect the correct number of terms for the current search.

Filters are displayed on a category/subcategory page, search page and brands page (if the {% link "Shop by Brand" ref_2LetICls %} module is enabled). 

The module shows filters dinamically based on the content of a page they are displayed at. Hence the filters for one category will differ from the filters for another and both of them will differ from the filters displayed on the search page, etc. 

<div class="ui stackable three column grid">
  <div class="column" markdown="span">![filters-1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_25POvGjV/filters-1.png)</div>
  <div class="column" markdown="span">![filter-2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_25POvGjV/filter-2.png)</div>
  <div class="column" markdown="span">![filters-3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_25POvGjV/filters-3.png)</div>
</div>

The set of filters to be displayed on a page is automatically narrowed down and is built based on the  relevant {% link "product attributes" ref_T90ZcEpP %}, {% link "product tags" ref_6nFoxYf1 %} and {% link "vendor" ref_4ahg5FLK %} info. Selected filters are saved in the URL so that one can easily share a link to the filtered list of products. It is not only handy but also advantageous from a SEO standpoint. 

Once the filter is applied, all the images and prices are instantly updated.

To configure filters, open the _Cloudfilters_ tab on the **Catalog** -> **CloudSearch & CloudFilters** page in the Admin area. 

![cloudfilters.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_25POvGjV/cloudfilters.png)

You'll see a screen with 2 tabs - SET UP FILTERS and SMART FILTER SELECTION FOR SEARCH.

The SET UP FILTERS tab is the main one. It contains filters gathered automatically through your store based on all the product attributes, tags and vendors defined. You can enable/disable the filters and change the filters settings:

<div class="ui stackable two column grid">
  <div class="column" markdown="span">![filter-settings-1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_25POvGjV/filter-settings-1.png)</div>
  <div class="column" markdown="span">![filter-settings.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_25POvGjV/filter-settings.png)</div>
</div>

If a filter is disabled it's not displayed in the storefront. 

Besides the filters listed in the SET UP FILTERS tab there are default filters (category, price and manufacturer) that are always present in addition to the filters you enabled. 

The SMART FILTER SELECTION FOR SEARCH tab is an advanced filtering system that can be used by the big stores with a wide range of products (and product attributes as a result) to narrow down the filters displayed on the search page in the storefront. Here you can define special filter categories based on customer's search query. As a result, only relevant filters will be shown.

To add a filter category hit the **Add Filter Category** button.

![smart-filter.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_25POvGjV/smart-filter.png)


You'll see a pop-up window where you'll need to define a semantic term and add filters from the list that match this category. Click **Add category** when you are done.

For the storefront search page SMART FILTERS if configured override the filters from the SET UP FILTERS tab.

{% note info %}
Semantic terms (categories) should correlate with the whole store category structure or product types to cover a certain group of products and should not overlap with each other. 
{% endnote %}
