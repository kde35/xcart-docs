The addon [**Value Added Tax / Goods and Services Tax**](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/uk-vat.html) should be used for tax setup when it's necessary to charge customers a value added tax (VAT) or a goods and services tax (GST).

This addon is designed specially for businesses in the UK, EU, Australia and other countries where an ability to charge VAT / GST is a must. The addon allows you to use different tax rates based on the membership level and address of the customer. It also supports tax exemption based on customer's VAT ID.

{% note info %}
Note that we have a special addon for {% link "Canadian taxes" ref_hxmof6xX %}.

To start using the addon "Value Added Tax / Goods and Services Tax", ensure that it is {% link "installed and enabled" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %} in your store.

Once installed the "Value Added Tax / Goods and Services Tax" addon adds the "VAT number" filed to the list of default customer {% link "profile fields" ref_gg1fQDgB %} that can be maintained and edited the same way all other fields are. 

Please find below some guidance on how to set up and enable VAT / GST calculation using the addon "Value Added Tax / Goods and Services Tax" for X-Cart 5.
