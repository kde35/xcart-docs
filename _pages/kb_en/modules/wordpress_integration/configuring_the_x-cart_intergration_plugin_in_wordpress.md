{% note warning %} 
The addon **X-Cart 5 to WordPress Integration** support has been discontinued. If you wish to sell products via your blog, we recommend the addon **[Buy button](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/buy-button.html "X-Cart 5 to WordPress Integration")**; it enables you to add product widgets with the Buy button right into your blog posts. If, however, you are interested in adding a Wordpress blog into your X-Cart online store, then consider the **[Blog System in X-Cart 5](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/blog-system-in-xcart-5.html "X-Cart 5 to WordPress Integration")** addon. 
{% endnote %}
