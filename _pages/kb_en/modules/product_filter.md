Let us imagine that you run an online store that has tons of different products. Each product has its own set of attributes like size, color, material, technical characteristics, and many others that make it distinct from other products. A shopper's decision to buy depends on these product attributes, and you as a seller can make a shopper's choice easier by using the Product filters addon. The addon enables your store visitors to use a filter based on product attributes that will help them to narrow down the search results and find the very product they need. Filter-based search can also include tags, a price range, and in-stock availability. You can add a filter-based search block on a category page in the store front end using the **Product Filter** addon.

If the addon **Product Filter** is not installed in your X-Cart store, you can install it from the X-Cart Marketplace. Follow the general instructions for {% link "installing and activating addons" ref_0fGEpvrh %}.

Before using the addon, you will need to cofigure it. Open the _Settings_ page and configure the addon according to your business needs.

The addon settings are as follows:

![settings.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6e82A7rL/settings.png)

   * **Enable "In stock only" filter**: If enabled, the 'In stock' selector will be added to the filter block. 

   * **Enable "Price range" filter**: If enabled, the filter will allow users to specify the desired price range.

   * **Enable "Attributes" filter**: If enabled, the filter block will display the choice of attributes available for the products. 

     {% note info %}
     For the "Attributes" filter to be displayed, you need to have attributes set up in your store. For more info on the configuration of attributes, see {% link "Product classes and attributes" ref_T90ZcEpP %}. 
     {% endnote %}

   * **Enable "Tags" filter**: If enabled, the filter will show the tags available for search.

     {% note info %}
     For the "Tags" filter to be displayed, you need to have product tags set up in your store. For more info, see {% link "Product Tags" ref_6nFoxYf1 %}.
     {% endnote %}

   * **Show only available attributes and tags for products in category**: If enabled, X-Cart generates a data cache that is used to display in the filter only the attribute values and tags that are actually used for the products in the category being viewed. 

     {% note info %} 
     Enabling this option will make a page load faster since only a set of particular attributes and tags will be counted, but not all the attributes and tags available in your store. It is essential for stores with a high inventory turnover ratio.
     {% endnote %}

   * **Cache reset mode**: This setting can be used to specify whether you want cache to be generated on the fly or to be removed when attribute, tag or product data is changed. The first option will allow working with the actual inventory but will slow down the page loading as it will be necessary to cache the filters each time. If you do not update your inventory too often, using the second option is recommended. 

     {% note info%}
     If the "Remove cache when ..." option is chosen a category page cache will be removed and generated anew the first time this page is opened after you change products, categories or attributes data. The first page loading may last more than usual as time will be spent on cache regeneration.
     {% endnote %}

   * **Sort order for class attributes** (available only if the "Attributes" filter is enabled): Here you can specify whether the attributes should be sorted alphabetically or manually.

     {% note info %}
     This setting affects only the attributes themselves, not their values. The values are sorted alphabetically. 
     {% endnote %}

   * **Generate the URL query string for filter with**: Can be set to _GET params_ or _hash_ depending on how you prefer the search URL to be assembled.

After adjusting the settings, be sure to click **Submit** to save the changes.

To specify the attributes that should be included into the product filter block on a specific category page in the store front end, you will need to do some configuration on the details page of that category. In your store's Admin area, go to **Catalog** > **Categories** > **_Category_Name_**.

![category.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6e82A7rL/category.png)

On the **Category Info** tab, find the setting **Classes for product filter**.

This setting enables you to specify what classes of attributes should be used to filter the products in the current category. The available options are as follows:
   * _All classes from this category_ - If you use this option, the filter will include the classes of all the products from this category. Note that the more classes and products a category has, the more time it will take to load the category page.
   * _Do not show the filter_ - If you use this option, this type of filter will not be displayed on the category page.
   * _Choose classes_ - If you use this option, you will be able to specify the exact class(es) on which the filter will be based. By using this option you can limit the number of classes applied. You can choose any classes available in your store.

Note that the product filter block wil not be displayed on the page of a category on the storefront if the category itself does not contain products. If the category has subcategories containing products, but does not have any products outside the subcategories, the **Classes for product filter** setting will need to be configured on the pages of the respective subcategories.

Once enabled and configured, the product filter will become available on the page of the category in the store front end.
