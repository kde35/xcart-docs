To install the addon **Back in Stock Notifications**, follow the instructions from {% link "Installing addons from the X-Cart App Store" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

{% note info %}
Make sure that out-of-stock items are visible on the storefront, otherwise your customers will not be able to set up back in stock notification subscriptions for them. To enable the display of out-of-stock items, ensure that the setting **How to show out of stock products** on the **Store setup** -> **Cart & Checkout** page is set to either _Show in all the sections_ or _Show only in categories and search listings_.
{% endnote %}

Once the addon has been installed, proceed to the addon settings page to configure the addon.

The addon settings page looks as follows:
![settings-page.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_7mZJltoM/settings-page.png)

Here you can adjust the following settings:

* **Send Back in stock notifications every** : Use this field to specify the frequency with which your store should send notifications to customers.
* **Allow customers to subscribe to back in stock notifications** : If this setting is enabled, your customers will be able to subscribe to back in stock notifications for products that have gone out of stock.
* **Allow customer to specify the product quantity they want to buy** : If this setting is enabled, your customers will be able to specify the quantity of product units they wish to buy. They will receive a notification only if the product inventory level is enough to cover the request.
* **Allow customers to subscribe to price drop notifications** : If this setting is enabled, your customes will be able to subscribe to notifications of the price drop down for a product.
* **Allow customer to specify the price they want to pay** : If this setting is enabled, your customers will be able to specify the price they are ready to pay for the product. They will receive a notification only if the price changes to meet the request.

Don't forget to **Submit** the changes to make them active.

Also a cart admin can edit the back-in-stock and price-drop-down notifications using the corresponding links at the bottom of the page.

{% note info %}
Email notifications can also be {% link "managed" ref_1qTqS245 %} in the **Store setup** -> **Email notifications** section of the admin area. 
{% endnote %}

To edit the notifications a cart admin should click either the _Edit back in stock notification_ or _Edit price drop notification_ link to be redirected to the notifications maintenance page. 

<div class="ui stackable two column grid">
  <div class="column" markdown="span">![bins-notification.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_7mZJltoM/bins-notification.png)</div>
  <div class="column" markdown="span">![pdd-notification.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_7mZJltoM/pdd-notification.png)</div>
</div>

Here the admin can enable/disable the notifications using the **State** ON/OFF trigger and change the message that is sent to the customers in the **Text** field if required. When the work is done it will be necessary to **Save changes**.
