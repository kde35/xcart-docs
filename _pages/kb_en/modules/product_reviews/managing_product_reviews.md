The Admin area of your store provides a dedicated section for product reviews - the Product reviews section (**Catalog** > **Reviews**). In this section you can view and manage all the reviews that have been created for the products in your store:

## Understanding Product Review Information
In each of the above-named locations, product reviews are presented in a table. For each review, the following information is available:

   * Product (This column is _not_ provided on the **Reviews** tab of the product information page): Name of the product that was reviewed.
   * Reviewer: Name (as specified by the user while creating the review) and email address of the user who submitted the review.
   * Review: The beginning of the comment about the product that was submitted by the reviewer in the body of the review. To view the entire comment, click on the **[...]** button on the line of the review.
   * Rating: Star rating of the product as was specified by the reviewer.
   * Status: Review publication status (_Published_ = The review is available online; _Pending_ = The review is on moderation, and the administrator has yet to approve the review for publication or to reject it).
   * Date: Date on which the review was submitted.
   * SEO (This column is provided only on the **Reviews** tab of the product information page): Whether the review should be included into the rich snippet shown for the page of the product when the page appears in search results by Google and other major search engines.

## Filtering Product Reviews
In the Product reviews section (**Catalog** > **Reviews**), a filter is provided above the Product reviews table allowing you to filter reviews and search for specific reviews based on product name, SKU, customer info, rating given by customer, review status, date range and so on.

## Deleting Product Reviews
To delete a review, click on the Trash icon on the line of that review in the table, then click **Save changes**. 
    ![xc5_productreviews_delete.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_XBriIS6B/xc5_productreviews_delete.png)

To delete multiple reviews, select the check boxes for those reviews and click the Trash button below the Product reviews table. Then confirm your wish to delete the selected reviews.

## Handling Pending Product Reviews
To moderate a _Pending_ review, click on the **[...]** button on the line of that review, check if the review requires editing (the review can be edited right away) and click either **Approve** or **Remove**.
    ![xc5_productreviews_moderate.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_XBriIS6B/xc5_productreviews_moderate.png)

To moderate multiple reviews at the same time, select the check boxes for those reviews, click the Check button below the table and select the option you require from the expanded button menu (_Approve selected_ will approve all the selected reviews and publish them on the product details page of the respective products; _Unapprove selected_ will unpublish the selected reviews resetting their status from _Published_ to _Pending_).

## Editing Product Reviews
To edit a review, click on the **[...]** button on the line of that review:
    ![xc5_productreviews_more_opts.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_XBriIS6B/xc5_productreviews_more_opts.png)

This opens the review for editing:
    ![xc5_productreviews_edit.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_XBriIS6B/xc5_productreviews_edit.png)

Edit the review as you require and click the button to save the changes (For reviews in the _Published_ state, this will be the **Update** button; for reviews in the _Pending_ state, the **Approve** button).

## Adding Product Reviews via the Admin Area
To add a new review via the Admin area, click the **Add review** button above the table:
    ![xc5_productreviews_add_from_admin.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_XBriIS6B/xc5_productreviews_add_from_admin.png)

Then use the blank form for review creation to create a review and save the changes:
    ![xc5_productreviews_add_from_admin1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_XBriIS6B/xc5_productreviews_add_from_admin1.png)

    ![xc5_productreviews_export_all.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_XBriIS6B/xc5_productreviews_export_all.png)
