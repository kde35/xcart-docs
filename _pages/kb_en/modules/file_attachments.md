Sometimes it may be necessary to enhance the regular product description with a file attachment to provide your customers with a manual (that is, for example, if you are selling household appliances) or with a detailed program description (for example, if you are selling educational courses, etc.)

You can do that using the addon [File attachments](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/file-attachments.html). 

The addon adds a special tab on the product page in the store back end -  "Attachments" - which enables you to attach files to the product; your store visitors can then download these files from the product page.

You can upload files from your local computer, from your local server or from a URL. The maximum file size is limited by the server settings.

To add an attachment to a product:

1. Click on the Add file button and choose the file source:
   ![att-2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0ZWKcob4/att-2.png)
    You can upload a file:
    * from your local computer 
    * from your local server
    * via URL

2. Choose the file and click **Upload**.  

The file will be added to the product:
   ![att-3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0ZWKcob4/att-3.png)
  
If necessary, you can add a file description, download the file, re-upload it or delete it.
