The Multicurrency addon works in a bundle with the addon {% link "Geolocation" ref_34F5BkhW %} that uses a free "GeoLite2 Country" database by MaxMind. 
![geolocation_addon.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2tPJubPU/geolocation_addon.png)

So please ensure that the addon Geolocation is enabled. The "GeoLite2 Country" database allows to define a customer's location accurate to a country. If you need higher accuracy, you can upload other databases on the Geolocation addon settings page.

A customer will see the currency and the language of the country his IP belongs to. A language switch will be available only if {% link "translations" ref_1frAlu26 %} are enabled in the store. If there are no particular currency and translation defined for the customers location the store content will be displayed in the default currency and language.

{% note warning %}
The currency that will be used for orders processing will depend on the payment gateway you are using. Some payments allow orders processing only in the default store currency. Others allow to accept payments in more than one currency. Please, check with your payment processing company for details.
