The [SEO Health Check module](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/seo-check.html "SEO Health Check") is a tool for keeping track of common SEO tasks that need to be done on the site. 

To install the module follow the general guidelines from {% link "Installing addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

When installed and enabled the module performs a series of tests and helps a store admin find SEO issues on the website. 

To start testings proceed to the _SEO Health Check_ tab of the **SEO settings** section (**Store setup** -> **SEO settings**):

By defaut the tab contains no info and a store admin can initiate a check by clicking the **Perform SEO Health checks** button:

It will take a while to analyze the store data and when the check is complete the results will be displayed on the same page:

The check results will provide recommendations on improving the store SEO performance and answer the following questions:

- Does your website use URLs that are {% link "search-engine friendly" ref_nJxrzFEZ %}?
- Are there pages having [non-unique titles](https://kb.x-cart.com/seo_and_promotion/optimizing_your_catalog_pages_for_seo.html#title-and-meta-elements "SEO Health Check") on your website?
- Do the titles on the product, category, brand and text pages have the optimal length?
- Will the [meta descriptions](https://kb.x-cart.com/seo_and_promotion/optimizing_your_catalog_pages_for_seo.html#title-and-meta-elements "SEO Health Check") of these pages appear in search engines nicely?
- Has an "alt" attribute been specified for images displayed on these pages?
- Is {% link "Google Analytics" ref_6NqAify2 %} used to track your website performance?
- Can search engines find an {% link "XML sitemap" ref_OqJ2oZTE %} and a [robots.txt file](https://kb.x-cart.com/seo_and_promotion/optimizing_your_catalog_pages_for_seo.html#robotstxt "SEO Health Check") for your site? Are these files up to date?
- Does your site use the [secure protocol](https://kb.x-cart.com/general_setup/store_security/index.html#step-2-use-ssl-certificates "SEO Health Check")?

It is recommended to run the tests from time to time in order to ensure that a website is ready for search engines.
