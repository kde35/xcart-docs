title: Mapping Global Attributes to eBay Item Specifics
order: 125
published: true

When you list an item on eBay, you can provide item specifics (like brand, size type, size, color, and style) for this item. The item specifics will appear at the top of your listing description, in a consistent format, making it easy for buyers to get the facts about the item. For more info on eBay item specifics, see https://www.ebay.com/pages/br/help/sell/item_specifics.html. 

X-Cart eBay integration enables you to synchronize the information available about an item in your X-Cart store in the form of global attributes with the item specifics on eBay. 

If you want to use the synchronization of your store's global attributes with eBay item specifics, you will need to choose how this synchronization should be done. Two methods are supported:
   * Synchronization based on the names of global attributes defined in your X-Cart store;
   * Synchronization based on the mapping rules defined in the eBay item specifics section of your X-Cart store.
   
The former of the two methods depends fully on the names of global attributes: your store will match the names of global attributes in your store to the names of item specifics on eBay; the ones whose names are found to be a match will be synchronized. To enable this type of synchronization, you need to enable the option “Use global attributes to synchronize eBay item specifics” in your eBay configuration general settings.
   
The latter of the two methods suggests that you configure your own mapping rules defining how your store's global attributes should translate to eBay item specifics, and vice versa. It also suggests that the option “Use global attributes to synchronize eBay item specifics” in your eBay configuration general settings should be disabled to prevent the name-based synchronization. The mapping rules can be configured via the **eBay Item Specifics** section (**Catalog** > **eBay item specifics**) of your X-Cart store Admin area.

To configure the mapping rules, you will need to go through every eBay category in which you are going to have listings, and link the names of global attributes used for the products on which these listings are based to the names of eBay item specifics used for this category.  

First, you need to select the **eBay category**:

Typically, it is a multi-step process: you start from a high-level category and keep selecting subcategories as long as you are prompted to.

Once you have reached your target category, you will see the message "Selection complete":
![xc5_ebay_mapping2_1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_0X2MIatv/xc5_ebay_mapping2_1.png)

The page will refresh automatically, after which you will be able to set your mapping rules:
