The addon X-Cart eBay Integration enables you to export product information from your store to eBay. When exported to eBay, product information is used to form a new eBay listing, or to update an existing eBay listing created previously (for example, to update the available quantity of the product in the listing or to end a listing). You can export the information of just some specific products or all the products in your store at once. The export can be initiated from the details page of a specific product or from a product list in X-Cart Admin.

**To export product information to eBay from a product list**:

1.  Go to the Products section of your X-Cart store's back end (**Catalog** > **Products**).
2.  Find the products that need to be exported and select these products by clicking the checkboxes to the left of their names.

    If you need to export to eBay all the products in your store, there's no need to select specific products; just make sure the filter above the product list is not setting any limitations.

3.  Select the operation that needs to be performed:
    *   If you need to export to eBay all the products that have been found and are now displayed in the product list, click the **Export all found to EBay** button:![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/9306473/9439182.png)
    *   If you need to export to eBay just the products you have selected, click the **More actions for selected** button in the second row of buttons and select the action you require from the button menu:

        *   _End products on eBay_- Select this to end the existing eBay listings;
        *   _Export products to eBay_ - Select this to export all the information pertaining to the products;
        *   _Export inventories to eBay_ - Select this to update the product quantities in your eBay listings (only inventory data will be exported);
        *   _Export images to eBay_ - Select this to update only the images of the products.
