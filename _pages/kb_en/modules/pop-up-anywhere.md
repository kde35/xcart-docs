The addon [Pop-Up Anywhere](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/popup-anywhere.html "Pop-up Anywhere") enables you to create an unlimited number of pop-ups/pop-overs and display them on the storefront instantly or on schedule, for all visitors or for certain groups of customers only. 

To install the addon, follow the instructions from the section {% link "Installing Addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

Once the addon has been installed, a new section - **Popups** - is added in the Admin area (**Discounts** -> **Popups**). This section can be used to create new and manage the existing pop-ups. The store administrator can enable/disable, edit or delete pop-ups. The page also enables the administrator to filter pop-ups by the name, as well as change the pop-up order by rearranging the list of pop-ups using the drag-n-drop feature.

{% note info %}
By default, the list of pop-ups contains four samples that are aimed to demonstrate four different types of a pop-up set-up: 
- a standard pop-up, 
- a pop-up with a custom template, 
- a notification bar,
- a notificaton bar with minicart and **Checkout** button. 

Some of the samples are enabled, some are not. You can disable all the samples or even delete them completely when you decide you do not need them any longer.
{% endnote %}

To create a new pop-up, click the **New popup** button at the top of the page. 

You will be redirected to the **New popup** page where you will need to configure the settings in four sections to create a pop-up. 

The sections are as follows:

### General Popup Settings
   
   The settings in this section can be used to specify the most general information about each pop-up. This information will appear in the pop-up list in the Admin area.  
   ![general-popup-settings.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5KvYsWjw/general-popup-settings.png)
   * **Administrative name** : A name to identify the pop-up (Will be used in the Admin area only).
   * **Enabled** : Whether the pop-up should be enabled right after it has been created.
   * **Active from** : The pop-up start date (optional).
     ![from-till.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5KvYsWjw/from-till.png)
   * **Active till** : The pop-up end date (optional).

### Popup Content
   
   This section defines the style and content of the pop-up as it should be displayed to the customers in the store front end.

   * **Popup type** : Choose the pop-up type from the drop-down list.
     * **Standard popup** : The pop-up will use the colors of the main store skin and will be displayed on the storefront according to the rules specified in the **Popup behaviour** and **Popup appearance** sections.

       ![standard-popup.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5KvYsWjw/standard-popup.png)
       {% note info %}
       All custom templates must be uploaded to the folder **`<X-Cart folder>/skin/customer/modules/QSL/PopupAnywhere/popup_templates/`** on the server where your X-Cart software is hosted. 
       Get more info on how to create a custom template in the following articles:
