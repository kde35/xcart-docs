The [U.S.P.S. module](http://www.x-cart.com/extensions/addons/usps.html) for X-Cart 5 allows you to use online shipping rate calculation via [USPS Web Tools Ecommerce API](http://www.usps.com/webtools).

This article assumes that the U.S.P.S module has already been {% link "installed and activated" ref_0fGEpvrh %} at your store.

To start using the module, you need to configure it. The module configuration settings can be accessed using one of the following methods:

1. In the Shipping section of your X-Cart store’s Admin area (**Store setup** > **Shipping**)
   * click the **Add shipping method** button:
![shipping.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_whrpZnV3/shipping.png)

   * and then choose the U.S.P.S shipping method in a pop-up:
![pop-up.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_whrpZnV3/pop-up.png)

2. In the Installed Addons section of your X-Cart store’s Admin area (**My addons** > **Installed addons**), locate the entry for U.S.P.S. module and click the **Settings** link below it:
![modules.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_whrpZnV3/modules.png)


The U.S.P.S. settings page looks like the following:

![settings.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_whrpZnV3/settings.png)


Below is an explanation of the settings that can be found on the U.S.P.S. settings page.

## USPS or Pitney Bowes selection

These are the most important settings, and after you specify them your X-Cart will start using USPS shipping rates.

![pitney.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_whrpZnV3/pitney.png)

If you decide to use USPS via Pitney Bowes you'll need to register an account with https://www.pbshippingmerchant.pitneybowes.com/accountInfo and then specify the email you used during the registration in the **'PitneyBowes merchant emailId'** field. 

If you already have an account with Pitney Bowes no additional registration is required, just fill in the **'PitneyBowes merchant emailId'** field with the registered email.

{% note info %}
Configuring U.S.P.S. via Pitney Bowes allows using integrated shipping labels.
{% endnote %}

If you prefer to use plain USPS, choose the USPS option in the drop-down and fill in the fields

![usps.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_whrpZnV3/usps.png)

You simply need to specify your **User ID** provided by USPS as well as **USPS API server URL**. 

Enter the URL provided to you by U.S.P.S. in the notification about your successful registration for the U.S. Postal Service's Web Tools Application Program Interfaces. For example:
http://stg-production.shippingapis.com/ShippingApi.dll
http://production.shippingapis.com/ShippingAPI.dll

{% note info %}
If you experience a problem that USPS worked fine in test mode, but does not work properly in live mode (usually you receive the **API Authorization failure. RateV4 is not a valid API name for this protocol** error message), you should [contact USPS support staff](https://www.usps.com/help/contact-us.htm) and ask them to transfer your account to production server.
