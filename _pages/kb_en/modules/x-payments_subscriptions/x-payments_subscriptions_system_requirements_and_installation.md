To install and use the addon X-Payments subscriptions, you need a working copy of X-Cart 5.1 or later connected to [X-Payments](https://www.x-payments.com/help/Main_Page) with the module {% link "X-Payments connector" ref_NaZh0d1b %}.

Note that to be able to charge customers for subscriptions periodically you will need to use a payment method with tokenization support. 

The module X-Payments subscriptions can be obtained via X-Cart’s Marketplace.

To install and enable the module on your system, follow the general module installation instructions. See {% link "Installing modules from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

As a result, you should have the module "X-Payments subscriptions" listed in your store's Installed Modules section:
