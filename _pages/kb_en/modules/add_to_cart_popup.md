The module [Add to Cart Popup](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/add-to-cart-popup.html) for X-Cart is an extension that improves the shopping experience of your store site visitors by showing to them a popup with what they have just added to their shopping cart, as well as a list of "You may also like"-type of product recommendations.

The popup is triggered by a shopper clicking the "Buy now"/ "Add to cart" button or using the drag'n'drop feature to add an item to the cart. The popup provides an instant confirmation of the shopper's add-to-cart action giving the shopper an assurance that the product has been added to their shopping cart successfully. In addition to that, the popup functions as an upselling / cross-selling tool that can provide the shopper with further recommendations as to what other products they may choose to buy. The popup provides convenient site navigation options allowing the shopper to proceed directly to checkout, to continue shopping or to go to the shopping cart page.

To use the Add to Cart Popup module, you need to make sure it is installed and enabled. For module installation instructions, see {% link "Activating and deactivating addons" ref_uEnDBBA7 %}. The module also needs to be configured. The module configuration settings can be found on the module _Settings_ page. You can access this page using the Settings link next to the module name in your list of installed modules:

To configure the module, you need to adjust the following settings:

![settings-1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_1iGC8Efj/settings-1.png)

The setting at the top of the page - **Enable a popup after a product is added to cart via drag-n-drop** - enables you to adjust the module behavior as to whether the Add to Cart popup should be displayed after a product has been added to the shopping cart using the drag'n'drop feature. By default, this setting is enabled, which means the Add to Cart popup will be shown to customers who have just added something to their cart via drag'n'drop. If, however, you feel that your customers might be vexed with the popup showing up in this context, you may prefer to disable the use of the popup with drag'n'drop by disabling the setting.
   
Another important decision that you will need to make while adjusting the module settings is whether you would like to provide product recommendations in the Add to Cart popup, and, if so, what type of products should be used as a source for such recommendations. By default, the Add to Cart popup will provide recommendations based on randomly selected products. If you are also using the modules {% link "Product Advisor" ref_72asis58 %} and/or Related Products, you will be able to choose other sources for product recommendations:

   * **Customers who bought this product also bought (Product Advisor module)**
   * **Related products (Related Products module)**
   * **Random products**

You will need to enable all the source options you wish to use and set their priority.

Your customers can proceed to checkout directly from the popup. 

They also have the option to continue shopping by closing the popup or get interested in the products it recommends, and either add it to cart or view the product details page.
