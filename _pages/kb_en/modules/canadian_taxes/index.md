This addon is similar to the {% link "Sales Tax" ref_7fGmqgPE %} addon, but allows to set up taxes only for Canadian provinces, and the tax names are GST/PST/HST/QST (The correct tax name to be shown to a customer is chosen automatically based on the customer's province).

To start using the addon "Canadian Taxes", ensure that it is {% link "installed and enabled" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %} in your store.
