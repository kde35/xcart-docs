The addon **X-Cart v4 to v5 Data Migration Wizard** migrates data from an X-Cart 4 based online store to X&#8209;Cart&nbsp;5.

It can migrate almost all types of X-Cart 4 data to X-Cart 5.

It also performs an overall check of your X-Cart 4 store feature set 4 and recommends what addons should be enabled in X-Cart 5 in order to match the functionality.

This way, after a data transfer, you only need to adjust your store's look and feel, install the missing addons and configure the settings that are not present in X-Cart 4.
