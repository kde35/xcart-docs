**Q: Will deleting abandoned carts from the abandoned carts list remove any data from my cart recovery statistics?**

**A:** No. Your store's cart recovery statistics is based on completed orders (orders that have been fully paid for), not on abandoned carts. By the time an order is added to the cart recovery statistics, the respective cart is no longer on the abandoned carts list. In other words, the carts on your store's abandoned carts list are not related to your existing cart recovery statistics in any way.

**Q: Is there a way to clear my store's cart recovery statistics?**

**A:** Your store's cart recovery statistics is actually a list of orders that were recovered as a result of customers using the cart recovery link in an abandoned cart reminder message. To clear your store's cart recovery statistics, you will need to delete the respective orders.

**Q: I am using the User permissions addon by X-Cart team. What permissions does a user need to be able to use the Abandoned Cart Reminder addon functionality?**

**A:** Manage orders.
