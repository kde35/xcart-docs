If a customer follows the cart recovery link from an abandoned cart reminder e-mail and places an order before their cart becomes abandoned again, their order is added to your store's cart recovery statistics.

To view your store's cart recovery statistics for a certain period:

1.  In your store's Admin area, go to the Statistics page (**Orders** >** Statistics**) and click the **Cart recovery** tab. 
2.  In the form at the top of the page, specify the period for which you would like to view statistics.
3.  Click **Search**. The statistics will be displayed below, in the Statistics for the period section:
