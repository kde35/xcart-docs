After the module has been installed and enabled, it needs to be configured.

To configure the module:

1.  In the list of your store's installed modules, locate the entry for Abandoned Cart Reminder and click the **Settings **link below it:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7503943/8718921.png)
    The "Abandoned Cart Reminder" module settings page opens:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7503943/8718922.png)

2.  Use the **Abandoned cart cut-off time** setting to specify the time period (in minutes) after which the module should list a customer’s cart as "abandoned". By default, the cut-off time is set to one hour after the customer last viewed the cart page. That works for an average product, but it makes sense to try different values to find the cut-off time that gives a better recovery rate for your products.

3.  Click **Submit** to save the changes.
