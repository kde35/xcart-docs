The addon [Shop by Brand](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/shop-by-brand.html "Shop by Brand") is aimed at promoting branded goods.

With this addon finding products of specific brands/manufacturers becomes much easier to customers. Especially to first-time visitors who do not know what exactly they are looking for.

To install the addon  please follow the steps described in {% link "Installing and Activating addons" ref_0fGEpvrh %}.

Once installed, find the addon in the list of your store's installed addons (**My addons** section) in the Admin area, open the addon settings page and configure the addon according to your business needs.

Here the store administrator can change the order of appearance of the brands the way he needs. By default, the brands are sorted alphabetically. Also, it's possible to edit the existing brands and add new ones if required. 

To create a new brand click the **New brand** button, to edit an existing brand click the brand name in the list. The procedure is similar, in both cases you'll need to feel in the fields with the info and save the changes.

You can specify the following info for your brands, the only required filed being the brand name:
* **Brand name**: Use this field to specify or edit the brand name here.
* **Brand logo** : Use this field to upload a brand logo here. 
* **Description** : A brand description that will be displayed on the brand's page.
* **Meta keywords** : The keywords to be used in the keywords META tag on the category page (for SEO purposes).
* **Meta description** : The description to be used in the description META tag on the category page (for SEO purposes).
* **Clean URL** : The product page Clean URL (for SEO purposes).

The buyers will see the Brands block on the home page and on any category page on the store front end. You can change the Brands block location using the [Webmaster mode](https://devs.x-cart.com/webinars_and_video_tutorials/using_webmaster_mode_in_x-cart_5.html "Shop by Brand").
