Some states consider shipping charges to be a necessary part of a taxable eCommerce transaction, and require online sellers to charge sales tax on delivery charges.

To configure a shipping tax:

1. Locate the **Click here to specify tax rates that will apply only to shipping charges** link on the Sales tax configuration page (**Store setup** > **Taxes**) and click on it to specify tax rates that will apply only to shipping charges:
   ![shipping-tax.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4nZM0iOX/shipping-tax.png)

2. Click the the **New Rate** button
   ![new-rate.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4nZM0iOX/new-rate.png)
      
3. Define a zone the tax will be applied to:
    ![zone]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4nZM0iOX/zone.png)

4. Set a tax rate in %:
   ![rate.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4nZM0iOX/rate.png)

5. Click **Save changes** to make the settings active.
      
If you have {% link "Tax Classes" ref_pAWOdG8N %} defined, the shipping tax set up will look as follows:

![tax-class.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4nZM0iOX/tax-class.png)

So you'll also need to define a tax class applicable to the shipping tax you are setting.
