The addon "Fractional and Fixed quantities" provides a number of product quantity related features for your X-Cart 5 online store.

With this addon you can:

*   set different quantity units for the different products in your store (useful if you need to *  sell candies by the pound, ribbon by the yard, fabric by the bolt, etc.);
*   sell the same product using different quantity units (for example, fabric by the yard and by the bolt);
*   sell products using decimal product quantities (for example, 0.5 meters of fabric);
*   sell products in packs containing fixed quantities of items (a dozen of eggs; a 6-count multipack of water bottles, a 60-count box of pens, etc.);
*   set allowed quantities which can be added to cart at a time (1 box, 5 boxes, 10 boxes, etc.)
