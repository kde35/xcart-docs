## Customer interface

### Product page

If decimal quantities have been allowed for a product by the seller, customers can specify the quantity they wish to purchase using numbers with a fractional part:

   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/9666749/9634630.png)

If the seller has set allowed quantities for adding some product to the shopping cart, on the page of that product on the storefront the **Qty** field is provided in the form of a selectbox from which customers can choose one of the allowed quantities:

   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/9666749/9634632.png)

If the product has custom quantity units defined, the quantity units can be selected from the selectbox on the right-hand side of the **Qty** field:

   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/9666749/9634634.png)

If the product has allowed quantities defined, and these allowed quantities are associated with specific quantity units, the selection can be performed using the combined selectbox with allowed quantities and quantity units:

   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/9666749/9634635.png)

The price is adjusted dynamically according to the product quantity and quantity units selected.

The addon {% link "Wholesale" ref_ttZa4qgu %} is supported with regard to decimal quantities. Also, minimum and maximum purchase quantities are adjusted if a customer switches from one type of quantity units to another.

### Cart page

On the cart page, product quantities are shown with product quantity units:

   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/9666749/9634629.png)

The product price is calculated and displayed based on what product units are being used.

### Checkout

If custom quantity units are defined, on the checkout page they are displayed next to the product quantities:

   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/9666749/9634636.png)

The product price is calculated and displayed based on the product units selected.
