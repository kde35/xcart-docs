A default X-Cart software package represents user interface in Englih and uses a US measurement system after the software has been installed. In adition to it there are also UK and Chinese packs that differ in language of the user interface and default address configuration. 

Any merchant located outside the given countries can adapt the default X-Cart software to a specific locale or market by installing a required language package to translate both the store admin area and the customer storefront and configuring the localization settings appropriately.
