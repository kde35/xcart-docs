Once you download X-Cart from [www.x-cart.com](http://www.x-cart.com/) and install it on your server, you get a store builder with the user interface displayed in the English language. 

But it will be "English" not only for the user interface but for the whole store set-up as well, meaning that X-Cart is configured to use the British measurement system, date and time format, etc. by default. 

It's possible to localize an X-Cart store to meet your country standards, time-zone and measurement system to sell comfortably within your own country.

Also, you can turn your X-Cart into a truly multi-language solution by installing language translation addons.
