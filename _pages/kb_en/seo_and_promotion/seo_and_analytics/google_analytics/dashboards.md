Preset Ecommerce reports in GA are incredibly powerful, but they don’t give you all the data you need at a glance. For that, you need a custom dashboard.

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an online store, you need to track the following data:

* total revenue
* transactions
* average order value
* average revenue per session
* average revenue per user
* products
* revenue per product
* revenue per traffic source
* e-commerce conversion rate per traffic source

Based on a custom sumary report of a kind you can get all the information on what is happening with the shop on a daily basis in a couple of minutes. All the data are collected on a single page.

To set up a report for your online store log in to Google Analytics, go to **Customization** -> **Dashboards** and hit the red **'Create'** button.

You'll be given an option to choose between **Blank Canvas** (a custom dashboard on your choice) and **Starter Dashboard** (a GA preset). Also you can import a dashboard from a [GA Solutions Gallery](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/gallery/#landing/start/ "Ecommerce dashboards").

To create a custom report that will track the stats on the parameters specified above choose **Blank Canvas**, name a dashboard and hit the **'Create Dashboard'** button. 

You'll see a screen of the kind

Each dashboard has space for 12 different widgets. Each widget displays a specific data set of your choosing.

To create a widget name it and choose the widget type - standard or real-time. Standard widgets reflect data for the selected time interval while real-time widgets show live data. Both standard an real-time widgets are categorized into types:

* metric / counter
* timeline
* geomap
* table
* pie (standard only)
* bar (standard only)

If you choose a table type do mind that the maximum number of rows is ten, and the maximum number of columns is three. If there are more rows in the table, it displays the first ten rows, sorted by the first metric.

Then choose a metric for the widget in the drop-down. If necessary you can add _filter_ to the metric. Once you hit **'Save'** this widget will be added to your dashboard.

You'll get a screen of the kind when all the widgets are created. If you want to edit the widgets, just click on them.

You can also create custom sessions for your dashboard by clicking on **'Add Segment'**.

By default, GA shows data from All Sessions, i.e. it will initially show you all traffic, regardless of the source. You can change this to only show data to your liking, whether it’s new visitors, paid traffic, organic traffic, mobile traffic, and so on.

To create a report for a certain period, choose the dates in the top right corner.

To change the widgets layout hit the **'Customize Dashboard'** button. Your options will be as follows:

Once a dashboard is set you can you can schedule how often reports are sent to your inbox: daily, weekly, or monthly. Use the **'Email'** button for the purpose.

You just need to set up the frequency and type in your email address. Using advanced options, you can also limit the time during which you’ll get the reports — from one to 12 months.
