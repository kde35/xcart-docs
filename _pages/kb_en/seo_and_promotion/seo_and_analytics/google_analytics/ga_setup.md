  * To find your Web Property ID:
    1. Log in to [Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics "Installing and Configuring Google Analytics Module"), using the Google account that owns the Analytics profile that you want to get the ID for.
    2. Choose the Analytics Settings tab
    3. Find the entry in the list for the Analytics profile that you need the profile for:
       Each profile has two rows:  the top one lists the URL of the site and profile ID, while the 2nd one has the name you have given the profile, view report-link, some statistics, and links to edit or delete the profile.

* **What are you tracking** : Choose between _single domain_ / _one domain with multiple subdomains_ / _multiple top level domains_ depending on your preferences. 
* **Google Analytics code version** : A preset value is [Universal Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3450662?hl=en "Installing and Configuring  Google Analytics Module"). Also, it's possible to set the value to Traditional.
* **Enable eCommerce Google Analytics** : Enable/Disable submitting ecommerce data to Google Analytics
* **Register purchase only on Paid status change** : When enabled, order data is sent to Google Analytics when an order becomes ‘Paid’. When disabled, X-Cart sends order when an invoice page shows up to a customer regardless of the order status.
* **Debug mode** : Enable to check all actions submitted to Google Analytics in a browser JS console.

**Submit** changes when the module configuration is complete. Google Analytics will collect staistics based on the settings you specified.
