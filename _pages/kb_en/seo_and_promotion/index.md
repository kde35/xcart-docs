Launching a store is not enough to start selling online. You need to promote the goods and/or services you offer and make your website visible for search engines like Google, Bing or Yahoo to attract customers to your store, as search engines tend to be the first place potential buyers turn to find a product or service they need. The higher your site is ranked in the search engines, the more traffic and potential customers you gain. 

X-Cart provides a variety of promotion and SEO tools that can help you to boost sales and increase traffic starting from SEO-friendly URLs to integrations with different types of SEO-analytics tools, to sales, to discounts, etc.

Keep in mind that optimizing and promoting your site will be a continuous process, as search engines are constantly surveying the internet to index and rank pages and your competitors will never stop the rival.
