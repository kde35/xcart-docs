## Introduction
On October 15, 2013 X-Cart (http://www.x-cart.com) did a webinar in conjunction with David Goodale of Merchant Accounts.ca (http://www.merchant-accounts.ca) regarding what business owners should know when accepting payments online. Establishing a credit card processing solution can be a daunting task, especially for a business that has not dabbled in card payments before.

The immediate issues that come to mind for just about every business owner are the costs that will be incurred when taking payments. However, costs are only a small part of the picture. In this webinar we address the role of a shopping cart, payment gateway and merchant account, why merchants need to apply in order to get a merchant account, risk and approval issues (to make sure your merchant account is approved), interchange and merchant industry pricing models, and PCI compliance.
