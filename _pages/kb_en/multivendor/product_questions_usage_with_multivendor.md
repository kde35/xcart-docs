When used with X-Cart Multivendor, the addon {% link "Product Questions" ref_2FZ36bkz %} enables email messages with product questions to be sent to the proper product owner:

   * If the product is owned by a vendor, the email message is sent to the vendor. 
   * If the product is owned by an administrator acting as a vendor, the email message is sent to them, respectively. 

In the store back end, the product owner can answer the questions about their products, and the answers are shown to the customers with the name of the product owner attached to them.

<div class="ui stackable two column grid">
  <div class="column" markdown="span"><i>Vendor answer in the Vendor area</i>![vendor-question.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2FZ36bkz/vendor-question.png)</div>
  <div class="column" markdown="span"><i>Vendor answer on the storefront</i>![cus-vendor-answer.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_2FZ36bkz/cus-vendor-answer.png)</div>
</div>
