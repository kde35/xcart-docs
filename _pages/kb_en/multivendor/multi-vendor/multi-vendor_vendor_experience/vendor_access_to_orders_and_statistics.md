Once an order has been placed for a vendor's product, the vendor can see the respective order added to the list of orders in the Orders section of the store's back end (**Orders** > **Orders list**):

By clicking on the Order # of this order, the vendor can view the order details.

In the "_Warehouse_" multivendor mode, if the original order contains products of more than one vendor, each of the vendors has the following order management capabilities:

*   can view only the information pertaining to the products they own;
*   can see the payment and shipping methods selected by the buyer, but cannot see the shipping cost;
*   cannot edit any order details, change the order statuses or add order tracking information (These functions are carried out by the administrator).

In the "_Vendors as separate shops_" mode, a separate order is formed for the products of each vendor, so each vendor gets a separate order to which they have full access. In this mode vendors have the following order management capabilities:

*   can view the list of ordered items, the payment method, the shipping method and the shipping cost;
*   can view and update the payment and shipping order statuses;
*   can edit any order details (for example, if a mistake was made when placing an order);
*   can add order tracking information.

Vendors can access their statistics on orders and bestsellers via the Statistics section (**Orders** > **Statistics**). The order statistics can be viewed via the **Order statistics** tab:

The bestsellers statistics can be accessed via the **Best sellers** tab:

Vendors can also track the movement of the money from the sales of their products to their account via the My transactions section (**My account** > **My transactions**):
