Depending on the {% link "multivendor mode" ref_nFq48dhr#ConfiguringtheMulti-vendormodule-MultivendorMode %} enabled for the store by the administrator, vendor users may or may not be able to choose which shipping methods should be available for their products:

*   In the "_Warehouse_" mode, the configuration of shipping methods is a job of the store administrator, whereas vendors do not have any shipping management capabilities. They simply do not need such capabilities, since the shipping fee for orders containing products of more than one vendor is calculated for the delivery of all the products in a single shipment from a single warehouse location. 
*   In the "_Vendors as separate shops_" mode, each vendor configures their own shipping method(s). The management of shipping methods by a vendor user takes place in the Shipping methods section (**Store setup** > **Shipping**) of the store's back end.
