In a multivendor X-Cart store, new sellers can apply for vendor accounts via the vendor registration page available via the "Become a seller" link on the storefront. Before anyone starts applying for vendor accounts via that link, the store administrator should adjust the contents of the vendor registration page and the set of form fields that will have to be completed by prospective vendors. This can be done via the Vendor registration form section of the Store setup > Cart & checkout page of the Admin area. 
The store administrator can change the welcome text to be displayed on the page and specify what information fields should be included into the vendor registration form. They can also specify which of the form fields should be required for completion by the prospective vendor.
