**Trusted/Non-trusted vendors** is an addon for use in a Multivendor X-Cart 5 store. It is intended for multivendor stores/online marketplaces that have strict policies regarding what products can be sold via the store/marketplace or have certain requirements regarding what kind of information and in what form must be presented by vendors for each product. The addon enables the storefront operator/store administrator to moderate the content of product pages created by the vendors before these pages get published in the product catalog and thus to ensure that the products/product descriptions created by the vendors are in compliance with the existing store/marketplace rules or policies.
