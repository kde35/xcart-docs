Each X-Cart package (Business, Multivendor and Ultimate) comes with 5 pre-installed themes that a user can choose from. In case none of the default themes suits the business it's possible to purchase and download a paid skin from the [Marketplace](https://market.x-cart.com/ecommerce-templates/ "Managing Skins").
