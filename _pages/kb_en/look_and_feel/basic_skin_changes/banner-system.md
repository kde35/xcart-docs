The default X-Cart 5 software allows adding banners to the store front-page (home-page) and category pages that is described in {% link "Changing your store's Welcome text and banner on the Front page" ref_Id69E4GT %}. 

If you want more banners that can be added to any page of the store and placed in different locations you can extend the default functionality with the [Banners System](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/banner-system.html "Adding Banners to Store Pages") module (paid for Business and Multivendor, included in Ultimate). 

Once {% link "installed and enabled" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %} the **Banner System** module functionality is added to the **Banners** section (**Content** -> **Banners**) of the store Admin area.

   * **Banner name** : Specify the banner name here (mandatory field).
   * **Categories** : Choose one or several category pages the banner should be displayed at (optional).
   * **Display on products pages** : If you enable this option the banner will be shown on all the products' pages of the selected category/ies. The option is ignored if no category is selected.
   * **Static pages** : Choose one or several static pages the banner should be displayed at (optional).

The image for a parallax block should be big enough to fit the hight and width of the page it's used at. If you do not set some image for parallax, then the first image from this banner will be used for parallax effect. HTML-banners will not be displayed in parallax block.
   * **Width, px** : You can specify the width of the banner here. It's recommended to leave this field empty for the image banners.
   * **Height, px** : You can specify the hight of the banner here. It's recommended to leave this field empty for the image banners and specify only the hight for HTML banners.
   * **Animation speed, in seconds** : Specify the preferred animation speed in seconds in this field.
   * **Delay, in seconds** : Specify the preferred delay in seconds in this field.
   * **Rotation effect** : Choose one of the available rotation effects for the banner.
   * **Enabled** : If enabled the banner is displayed in the storefront.
