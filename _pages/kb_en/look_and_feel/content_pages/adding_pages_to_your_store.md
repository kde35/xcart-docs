Imagine that you want to tell your customers about your company or to explain your store's shipping and returns policy. X-Cart does not provide special pages for those needs; however, it allows you to add your own pages using the same style as the rest of your store. Before you get started with this task, make sure that you have the **Simple CMS** module installed and enabled. If not, {% link "install and activate it" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}.

To add a new page to your X-Cart store:

1.  In your store's Admin area, go to the Pages page (**Content > Pages)** and click the **New page** button.
    ![pages-1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_Ptf5vaPn/pages-1.png)

2.  The form for creating a new page opens:
    ![pages-2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_Ptf5vaPn/pages-2.png)

3.  Provide information about the new page (**Name, Content, Keywords, Image**, etc.)
    Specify a clean URL for the page or choose to auto-generate one. To make the page visible on the site, be sure to select the **Enabled** check box.

4.  Click the **Save** or **Save and close** button at the bottom to save the changes.

    The page will be created.
    
Now if you look at your store's Pages list, you should be able to see the newly created page on the list: 
    ![pages-3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_Ptf5vaPn/pages-3.png)

{% note info %}
If you want to include a link to this page into your store's Primary or Footer menu, go to the Menus page (**Content > Menus**) and {% link "create a menu item" ref_BDykFBbw %} for the respective menu with the link to this page.
{% endnote %}
