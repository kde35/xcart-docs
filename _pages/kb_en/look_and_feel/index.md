They said "Good clothes open all doors" hence choosing a store theme is a serious task for an ecommerce business owner. A theme should not only be attractive but also appropriate and meet particular business needs. So don't hurry up and take your time to make a right decision.

X-Cart offers 5 free color schemes for your store out of the box and over [70 template add-ons](https://market.x-cart.com/ecommerce-templates/ "Look and feel") that you can use if none of the free five suits you. With any theme you choose you'll get a stylish, responsive, fully customizable and well-suited solution. 

When the template choice is left behind start with simple skin manipulations essential for almost every store:

*   {% link "Basic Skin Changes" ref_3vgykcgf %}
*   {% link "Managing images" ref_zyQIOcia %}


If you are ready to delve into the process and need to add custom changes to the store layout go further and use Theme Tweaker to edit your store’s look & feel easily — change the position of the blocks in drag and drop fashion or choose a pre-made layout type. Theme Tweaker even allows to modify templates quickly by clicking on the element while browsing the storefront, to apply additional styling with Custom CSS option, to customize JavaScript and to build unique email notifications templates.
