X-Cart software performance vitally depends on the server it's installed at, as even a perfect ecommerce solution can be ruined by a poor and improper server environment. Hence a store owner should pay special attention to the [X-Cart server requirements](https://kb.x-cart.com/general_setup/installation_guide.html#server-requirements "Setting up X-Cart 5 environment") when choosing a hosting for the store.

After a hosting company has been chosen, a store owner should make sure the server is properly configured for the best X-Cart software performance:
