X-Cart has a biult-in list of 249 countries of the world with states configured for 11 of them (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Thailand, United Kingdom and United States). All information on countries and states in X-Cart is based on Wikipedia.

A store admin can enable/disable the countries used in the store and add/edit states for countries if necessary.

## Managing Countries

The countries list in X-Cart can be checked on the **Countries** page in the admin area (**Store setup** -> **Countries, states and zones**).

On this page a store admin can enable/disable countries and add states to countries if necessary.

To change a country status a store admin should:

1. Locate the country the changes are to be applied to.
   For this purpose the store admin can either check the list of the countries one by one or use the Search bar available on the page:
