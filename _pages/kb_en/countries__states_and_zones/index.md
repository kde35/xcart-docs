Customer location in X-Cart is used when setting up {% link "taxes" ref_kJmd7K27 %} and {% link "shipping" ref_7tvT7GEK %}. Hence a proper determination of a customer location plays a great role for the whole store set-up and maintenance.

Customer locations available for shipping and taxation in X-Cart can be configured using the **Countries, states and zones** section in the admin area (**Store setup** -> **Countries, states and zones**).

By default, X-Cart has a biult-in information on 249 countries of the world with states configured for 11 of them (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Thailand, United Kingdom and United States). 

A store admin can enable/disable countries that are used in the store, change/delete states for the preconfigured countries and add states for the countries which don't have them in the default configuration. The countries and/or states can then be used to set up customer address zones that will be a base for the taxes and shipping configuration.

_In this section:_

*   {% link "The “All Addresses” (Default) Zone" ref_4kPvWTw2 %}
*   {% link "Setting up Address Zones" ref_r68iO5Rm %}
