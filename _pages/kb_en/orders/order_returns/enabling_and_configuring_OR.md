You will see a screen of the kind:

![settings-1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5JucPxO8/settings-1.png)

You can also find these settings in the **Store setup** -> **Return reasons** section of the Admin area.

The preset return reasons are:
* _Damaged item_
* _Wrong description_
* _Wrong item_

The default reasons are sorted alphabetically. The sorting affects the order the reasons are displayed to customer.

You can change the reasons sorting by drag-n-dropping. Also you can delete unnecessaty reasons, rename them and add new if required.

Don't forget to **save changes** when done.
