To claim for return of an existing order a customer should open the **Orders** section in his account in your X-Cart store front end, find the order in question and hit the '**Claim for return**' button on the _Order Details_ page if the order is permitted for returns.

The customer will be redirected to the _Create Return_ page where he can specify the reason for return and leave a comment if necessary.
