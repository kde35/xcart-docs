Not everyone who adds a product to their cart completes the checkout. When a potential customer provides their contact information but doesn't complete the order, their cart is stored as an abandoned checkout.

Abandoned checkout recovery is available only for the Online Store sales channel. Abandoned checkouts on Shopify POS or third party sales channels will not receive a checkout recovery email.

If a customer doesn't enter their email address before they abandon the checkout, then you can't send them an abandoned checkout notification. Customer accounts in your store are not created for these customers. Items in a customers cart at the time that they abandoned the checkout are not saved.
