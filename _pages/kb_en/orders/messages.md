An easy and convenient way to reach the seller gives customers confidence in the business and breeds customer loyalty. In an X-Cart store, order related communication between the customers and the seller can be facilitated with the addon [Messages](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/order-messages.html). This addon enables customers to ask questions and give feedback about their orders and the seller (the store administrator or, in the case of a Multivendor store, a vendor) to respond to the communication from the customer by answering their questions and resolving cases. Detailed information on the use of this addon is available in the {% link "Messages Addon" ref_0pnZpHq3 %} section of this manual.
