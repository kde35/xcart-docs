Every online store owner dreams of being successful and having a well-recognized brand. However, the more popular your brand is, the more likely it is to become a target of online fraud.


When it comes to fraud, not doing anything can be just as costly as investing in a fraud detection & prevention solution. The best way to protect yourself from fraud is to avoid chargebacks at all costs and prepare for when it happens. In combating fraud, don't forget to think about the customer and ensure their experience isn't compromised. Blocking suspicious purchases without detailed evidence can lead to an increase in cart abandonment.

So you better keep an eye on any suspicious orders coming your way. Being equipped with the necessary tools is key in everyday fraud management,


The Friendly Fraud
Contrary to what the name suggests, there’s nothing friendly about this type of fraud. It happens when a customer purchases a product with their own credit card, and issues a chargeback (in some cases deliberately), claiming an item was never received or that they never made the charge.

If you think about your customer FAQs, you’ll quickly realize that they’re all in some way or form a distant relative of the friendly fraud. “My order never arrived although the tracking information states it did” might be the most popular of them all. Turns out you’ve been dealing with this type of fraud on a daily basis.

How to prevent friendly fraud?
You should make sure your credit card descriptors match your business name. A lot of times, chargeback fraud happens because customers don’t recognize the company name on their card statements.

Also, if you can, only use shipping with tracking. In case customers approach you asking for a refund, it’s the best evidence you can provide to prove the products were delivered to their door.

Last but not least,  have clear reshipping, refunds, and return policies.

Get your hands on fraud protection software that will help you detect high-risk transactions and analyze other risk factors to prevent and reduce fraudulent activities on your store. Some of the ones we mentioned before are Sift Science, Kount, Signifyd.
