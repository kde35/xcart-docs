In X-Cart stores that use payment processing via [X-Payments](https://www.x-payments.com/), it is possible to configure and sell subscription products, i.e. products available on subscription. The idea is that a buyer does not just buy a certain product once, but purchases a subscription that allows them to make regular periodic payments for the product. The product in this case may be some kind of service requiring repeat billing (like hosting or technical support), goods delivered periodically (various kinds of e-goods, magazines, beauty boxes, food, etc.), or any kind of product for which you are willing to accept payments in installments. Subscription products are enabled by X-Cart's addon [X-Payments subscriptions](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/x-payments-subscriptions-and-installements.html). More information on using the addon is available in the section {% link "X-Payments Subscriptions" ref_8VFoqBFZ %} of this manual.
