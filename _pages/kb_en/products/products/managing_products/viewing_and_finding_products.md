You can view your products in the Products section of the store back end:
   ![xc5_products_view_products.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5znzAqDd/xc5_products_view_products.png)

By default you can see a list of all the products. If necessary, you can filter this list by specifying the parameters you require in the search/filter form in the upper part of the section:
   ![xc5_products_filter.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5znzAqDd/xc5_products_filter.png)

Note that this form contains more fields than are immediately visible. You can easily expand the form by clicking on the "pull down" arrow in its lower part for access to all the fields.
   ![xc5_products_filter1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_5znzAqDd/xc5_products_filter1.png)

The set of filtering fields available to you in the search/filter form may be different from what you see in the screenshot above as it depends on the set of addons/features enabled in your store.
