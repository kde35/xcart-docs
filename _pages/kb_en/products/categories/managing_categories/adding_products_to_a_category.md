X-Cart allows to add products to a category in several different ways.

1. **Import**

   Use this method if you need to add multiple products to a category and your store it not yet populated with products. 

   See {% link "How to import data" ref_glDc6kA1 %} for a detailed guidance on products import.

2. **Bulk editing**

   Use this method if your store is already populated with products and you need to assign/re-assign categories for products. 

   See [Bulk edit categories and tags](https://kb.x-cart.com/modules/bulk_edit.html#bulk-edit-categories-and-tags "Adding Products to a Category") for a detailed guidance.

3. **Manual product creation**

   Use this method if you need to add one or several new products to a category populated with products already.

   To add a product to a category in X-Cart:

    * In the store back end, find the category that you want to add products to and open the _Product_ tab on the category details page.

   * Click the **Add product** button. 
     You will be redirected to the _Add products_ page (**Catalog** > **Products** > **Add products**) where you can {% link "add products" ref_fhzzxDTy %} to the category one by one.
