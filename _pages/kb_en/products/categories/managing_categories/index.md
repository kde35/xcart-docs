Categories allow to group products together to make them easier to find and browse for shoppers.

A product can be assigned to multiple categories, and categories can be based on a set of similar type or product features that matter the most to your customers, such as:

- Men, Women, and Kids categories for clothing/apparel
- New and Used categories for cars
- a Sale category for discounted items

Below is how the default categories are dispayed on a storefront using the X-Cart CrispWhite skin:

The way categories appear on **your** storefront depends on your store’s theme.

Go to **Catalog** > **Categories** section of the store admin area to create, organize and manage your store’s categories.
