You can configure your X-Cart 5 store to hide the cart icon and remove the "Add to cart" and "Buy" buttons and to disable checkout turning your online store into a catalog of your goods and services. 

It's good if you need an eCommerce website to demonstrate your products and services online rather than to sell them. 

To make this possible, enable the addon Catalog as described in {% link "Installing addons from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %}. 

The Catalog addon functionality can be extended or substituted with the following modules:
* {% link "Call for Price" ref_3K1pJExV %}
* {% link "Hide Prices" ref_46jNUlWG %}

These addons enable you to hide prices but keep checkout available to customers.
