The addon **Product comparison** allows shoppers to compare different products in your store's catalog. You can install it from the Marketplace:

Once the **Product comparison** addon has been enabled, shoppers will see the **Compare** option when they hover over any product in the store's front end.

They can use this option to select products for comparison. The selected products will be added to the comparison list. For example, in the screenshot below you can see two products selected for comparison:

To compare the selected products, a customer needs to click the **Compare** button at the bottom of the comparison list. The result will be a table comparing the selected products based on such parameters as price, weight and custom attributes of the selected products.

Note that customers can use the **Differences only** check box option to chose whether they want to see only the parameters that differ between the selected products or all the parameters available for comparison.
